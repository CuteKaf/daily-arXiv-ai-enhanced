### [1] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决开放集识别中过度自信问题的框架，通过参数扰动估计预测不确定性，并使用两阶段分类器来更好地区分已知和未知类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别中，当未知样本与已知类别语义相似时，模型往往会对其分配过高置信度，导致误分类为已知类别，这种现象称为过度自信，会模糊已知与未知类别之间的决策边界。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：基于扰动的预测不确定性估计模块（通过可控参数扰动生成多样化预测并量化预测不确定性），以及具有不同学习分类器的未知检测模块（作为两阶段过程，利用估计的不确定性改进已知和未知类别的区分）。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的框架在开放集识别性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式缓解类别间重叠引起的过度自信问题，有效提升了开放集识别的性能。

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [2] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于少样本视频目标检测的新方法，通过选择性传播高置信度目标特征来保持时间一致性，无需复杂的目标管提议，在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统检测方法需要大量训练数据的问题，应对视频中目标遮挡和外观变化带来的时间一致性挑战，避免使用计算成本高且需要特定任务训练的复杂区域提议方法。

Method: 采用目标感知的时间建模方法，包含过滤机制选择性传播高置信度目标特征，使用少样本训练的检测和分类头结合聚焦特征传播，实现高效特征演进和噪声减少。

Result: 在5-shot设置下，AP提升分别为：FSVOD-500 3.7%、FSYTV-40 5.3%、VidOR 4.3%、VidVRD 4.5%；在1-shot、3-shot和10-shot配置下也表现出改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过目标感知的时间建模有效解决了少样本视频目标检测中的时间一致性和泛化问题，无需依赖显式目标管提议，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态图像融合方法依赖任务特定模型导致训练成本高、可扩展性有限的问题，以及生成方法采样效率低下的挑战。

Method: 采用流匹配范式实现直接概率传输，收集多模型融合结果作为先验，使用任务感知选择函数筛选可靠伪标签，引入融合精炼模块分解增强退化组件，并集成弹性权重巩固和经验回放机制支持多任务学习。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为多模态图像融合提供了一种高效统一的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升了采样效率和模型轻量化程度。

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [4] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的轨迹无关碰撞检测框架，通过扩散模型生成合理的未来路段地图并与监控地图比较来检测碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时碰撞检测对于开发主动安全管理策略和提高交通效率至关重要，需要解决轨迹获取和车辆跟踪的限制。

Method: 使用两阶段框架：第一阶段Mapfusion扩散模型通过噪声到正常的过程生成路段地图，结合时间动态嵌入和ControlNet背景上下文；第二阶段通过比较监控地图与生成地图来检测碰撞。

Result: Mapfusion成功生成了基于学习运动模式的真实路段演化地图，在不同采样间隔下保持鲁棒性，真实世界碰撞实验表明该方法能准确检测碰撞。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法在准确检测碰撞方面有效，为轨迹获取受限情况下的实时碰撞检测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [5] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对地震数据的自适应双网格基础模型训练策略（ADATG），通过希尔伯特编码和频谱分解处理地震数据的高频和低频特征，采用分层训练策略提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统视觉变换器（ViTs）在处理地震数据时忽略了内在模式，无法有效捕捉高频和低频信息，而地震数据具有独特的频率特征需要专门的处理技术。

Method: 使用频谱分解分离高频和低频分量，采用分层希尔伯特编码表示数据，并基于频率原理提出自适应训练策略，先关注粗粒度信息再逐步细化到细粒度特征。

Result: 广泛的实验证明了所提训练方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于地震图像高频和低频特征的数据编码和训练策略对于增强视觉地震基础模型的预训练具有重要意义。

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [6] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于面部微动态分析的被动性痴呆筛查方法，通过分析面部运动学特征（眨眼动态、嘴部运动、注视变化等）来检测早期神经认知变化，无需语言或文本信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有痴呆筛查方法主要依赖语音或脚本访谈，限制了在临床环境外的应用，且预测结果与语言和转录紧密耦合。作者希望开发一种语言无关、可在自然环境中大规模应用的被动筛查方法。

Method: 通过稳定面部信号，将面部微运动转换为可解释的时间序列，平滑处理后提取短窗口的紧凑统计特征。分析运动在多个通道中的分布而非幅度，使用轻量级分类器进行预测。

Result: 在YT DemTalk数据集（300个视频片段）上，注视不稳定性和嘴部/下颌动态是最具信息量的线索，模型达到AUROC 0.953、AP 0.961、F1分数 0.851、准确率 0.857。

Conclusion: 面部微动态分析可有效用于痴呆筛查，提供了一种无需语言、可在自然环境中大规模应用的被动筛查方案，且性能优异。

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [7] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe是一个基于认知科学的视觉推理基准框架，将链式帧推理分解为6个认知维度和24个子任务，首次对视频模型作为推理器进行定量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注保真度或对齐度，无法评估链式帧推理能力，导致无法系统理解模型在多步规划、算法逻辑和抽象模式外推方面的核心认知能力。

Method: 通过多源数据整理、最小提示协议和混合VLM辅助评估，将链式帧推理分解为六个认知维度（从感知逻辑到抽象规划）和24个子任务。

Result: 在SOTA系统上的实验揭示了视觉质量与推理深度之间的显著差距，建立了基线和诊断工具。

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe为推进真正的世界模拟器提供了定量评估框架，揭示了当前模型在推理能力方面的局限性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [8] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出基于排序的损失函数来解决基于热图的人体姿态估计中的三个主要问题：MSE损失无法有效提升关节定位精度、热图的空间和类别不平衡、以及评估指标与损失函数之间的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于热图的姿态估计方法存在三个核心问题：(1) MSE损失对所有像素偏差同等惩罚，无法专注于锐化峰值；(2) 热图存在空间和类别不平衡；(3) 损失函数与评估指标(mAP)不一致。这些问题限制了姿态估计的精度提升。

Method: 提出基于排序的损失函数，通过理论分析和实证研究证明其优于常用的热图损失(MSE、KL散度)。该方法提高了置信度分数与定位质量之间的相关性，从而在NMS过程中实现更准确的实例选择。

Result: 在三个数据集(COCO、CrowdPose、MPII)上验证了RSPose的有效性，在COCO-val集上使用ViTPose-H模型达到79.9 mAP，超越了之前的最优结果。同时将SimCC Resnet-50在COCO-val集上的性能提升了1.5 AP，达到73.6 AP。

Conclusion: RSPose是首个提出与评估指标(mAP)对齐的损失函数的人体姿态估计方法，通过基于排序的损失函数有效解决了传统热图方法的三个核心问题，显著提升了姿态估计性能。

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [9] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出碰撞声源分割任务(CS3)，从碰撞声音中识别并分割视觉场景中产生声音的物体，使用弱监督方法和基础模型(CLIP和SAM2)，在EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类多感官感知能力启发，希望从碰撞声音中识别产生声音的物体，解决碰撞声音来自两个物体交互的独特挑战，特别是在视觉场景杂乱、物体小、交互短暂的第一人称视频中。

Method: 提出弱监督的音频条件分割方法，利用基础模型(CLIP和SAM2)，结合第一人称线索(如手中物体)来识别可能的碰撞声源物体。

Result: 在两个新基准EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3上，方法比竞争基线在mIoU指标上分别提升3倍和4.7倍。

Conclusion: 提出的CS3任务和方法有效解决了从碰撞声音中分割视觉声源物体的挑战，在第一人称视频中表现出色。

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膀胱癌复发率高（达78%），术后监测至关重要，但多序列增强MRI解读困难，且缺乏专门用于复发评估的MRI数据集，阻碍了AI辅助诊断工具的发展。

Method: 提出H-CNN-ViT分层门控注意力多分支模型，通过选择性加权全局（ViT）和局部（CNN）路径特征，实现平衡且有针对性的特征融合，独立处理每个模态以优化捕获和整合各成像通道的独特属性。

Result: 在自建数据集上评估，H-CNN-ViT达到78.6%的AUC，超越了现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为膀胱癌复发预测提供了有价值的基准数据集和有效的深度学习模型，推动了AI在膀胱癌术后监测中的应用。

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP是一个视觉语言框架，用大型语言模型替换CLIP的文本编码器，通过可学习提示增强跨模态对齐，解决了CLIP在长文本医学报告处理中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的文本编码器只能处理77个token，限制了其在信息丰富的长文本放射学报告中的应用。现有的领域特定编码器虽然有所改进，但仍受限于512个token的输入长度和相对浅层的语义理解。

Method: 提出QwenCLIP框架，用LLM基础的嵌入模块（如Qwen3-Embedding）替换CLIP的文本编码器，并引入可学习提示来增强跨模态对齐，利用LLM的扩展上下文窗口和更丰富的表示能力。

Result: QwenCLIP能够从长格式临床文本中捕获全面的医学语义，显著改善了医学图像-文本对齐和在放射学基准测试中的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用LLM的扩展上下文窗口和丰富表示能力，QwenCLIP有效解决了CLIP在长文本医学报告处理中的限制，提升了医学视觉语言任务的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法在医学图像高维背景下存在局限性，无法充分利用详细的解剖特征，需要改进特征选择和表示能力。

Method: 集成EfficientNet和VGG19，加入伪牛顿增强层进行智能特征权重调整，以及稀疏诱导特征减少层去除冗余特征，形成多层框架。

Conclusion: 该架构克服了传统迁移学习的限制，为医学图像自动诊断工具的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Hema是一个用于数字血液病理学的多任务统一模型，整合了检测、分类、分割、形态预测和跨多种疾病的推理功能，解决了现有方法无法提供统一多任务多模态推理的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字血液病理学方法（包括单任务、视觉语言、WSI优化和单细胞血液学模型）存在关键限制：无法在数字血液病理学的复杂性中提供统一的多任务多模态推理。

Method: 基于Hema-Former多模态模块构建，该模块在层次级别桥接视觉和文本表示，支持不同粒度下的检测、分类、分割、形态学、掩码语言建模和视觉问答等任务。利用46个公开数据集，包含超过70万张图像和2.1万个问答对。

Conclusion: Uni-Hema为多任务多模态数字血液病理学建立了新标准，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了瞬态沟壑自动检测中的标注数据稀缺问题，为土壤侵蚀监测提供了可行的弱监督解决方案。

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

TL;DR: SAE-MCVT是首个可扩展的实时多摄像头车辆跟踪框架，通过边缘设备处理视频流并传输轻量级元数据，在中央工作站进行跨摄像头关联，实现了城市规模部署的实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCVT研究过于关注准确性而忽视了实时性和可扩展性，这在城市规模应用中随着摄像头数量增加变得愈发重要。

Method: 系统包含边缘设备和中央工作站。边缘端处理RTSP视频流，进行目标检测、跟踪、地理映射和特征提取，仅传输车辆位置和深度外观特征。中央端基于自监督摄像头链接模型学习相邻摄像头的时空关系进行跨摄像头关联。

Result: 在RoundaboutHD数据集上，SAE-MCVT在2K 15 FPS视频流上保持实时操作，IDF1得分达到61.2。

Conclusion: 这是首个适用于城市规模部署的可扩展实时MCVT框架，解决了现有方法在实时性和可扩展性方面的不足。

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在道路安全概念理解方面存在显著差距，需要进一步研究来弥合这些差距。

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于课程学习的相对策略优化方法(CuRPO)，通过利用CoT长度和广义交并比(gIoU)奖励作为复杂度指标，从简单到复杂逐步组织训练数据，以解决强化学习微调CoT推理在视觉定位任务中性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现基于强化学习的CoT推理微调在视觉定位任务中会随着CoT输出变长或复杂而性能下降，且增加数据集规模并不总能提升性能，这促使作者开发新的训练策略。

Method: 提出CuRPO方法，使用CoT长度和gIoU奖励作为复杂度指标，采用课程学习方式从简单到困难逐步组织训练数据。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和LISA数据集上的实验表明，CuRPO显著优于现有方法，在RefCOCO上提升高达+12.52 mAP，且在少样本学习场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: CuRPO是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，特别适用于处理具有模糊和复杂文本描述的任务，在视觉定位任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

Motivation: 探索为视觉Transformer注入跨模态有益归纳偏置的新方法，通过无视觉语义内容的程序生成数据预训练，让模型内化抽象计算先验。

Method: 使用形式语法等简单算法生成无视觉语义内容的程序数据，在预热阶段绕过视觉补丁嵌入机制预训练ViT，然后进行标准图像训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上，仅用1%训练预算的程序数据预训练，最终准确率提升超过1.7%，1%程序数据效果相当于28%的ImageNet-1k数据。

Conclusion: 这种方法为实现数据高效和领域无关的预训练策略提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Method: 发现跨运动通用的技能属性，训练多模态语言模型生成针对新视频的可操作反馈（如"多抬手以产生更多力量"）和熟练度评级（如早期专家）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的跨运动和同运动设置验证中，相比现有技术获得高达60%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 通过抽象出指示人类技能的共享行为，所提出的视频表示方法比现有技术具有更好的泛化能力，丰富了当前的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

Motivation: 解决当前自动驾驶系统在泛化能力方面的限制，特别是处理未见场景和不同传感器配置的能力，同时避免混合系统的不一致性和端到端方法的高计算成本。

Method: 引入RSD框架和RiskHead插件模块，从视觉语言模型中提取因果风险估计并蒸馏到鸟瞰图特征中，生成可解释的风险注意力图。

Conclusion: RSD通过增强BEV表示的风险注意力，提高了自动驾驶系统处理空间边界和风险对象的能力，更符合人类驾驶行为，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Motivation: 解决室内场景理解中光学传感器存在的遮挡问题和隐私风险，同时克服毫米波雷达低空间分辨率的限制，实现鲁棒且保护隐私的室内场景理解。

Method: 提出双角度多径增强方法，显式建模到达角和离开角来恢复次级反射；采用仿真到现实的层次扩散框架，将碎片化的雷达响应转化为完整的布局重建和物体检测。

Result: 在布局重建方面将Chamfer距离降低60%（降至16厘米），首次实现基于毫米波的物体检测，达到58% IoU；构建了包含5万帧数据的大规模基准数据集。

Conclusion: RISE为使用单静态雷达实现几何感知和隐私保护的室内场景理解建立了新的基础，证明了多径反射在几何推理中的价值。

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

Motivation: 人类能轻松识别MRI切片的解剖平面方向，但自动化系统难以完成此任务。缺失平面方向元数据会复杂化分析、增加数据集合并时的域偏移，并降低诊断分类器的准确性。

Result: 2.5D模型准确率达99.49%，比2D参考模型的98.74%提升显著，错误减少60%。在脑肿瘤检测任务中，元数据增强策略将准确率从97.0%提升至98.0%，误诊减少33.3%。

Conclusion: 2.5D上下文对MRI平面方向识别至关重要，生成的元数据能显著提升下游诊断任务的性能。模型已集成到交互式Web应用中并开源提供。

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中边界模糊和标注困难的问题，传统主动学习需要专家标注整个感兴趣区域，既耗时又认知负荷高。语言指导提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出LINGUAL框架：接收专家的自然语言指令，通过上下文学习将其转换为可执行程序，自动执行相应的子任务序列，无需人工干预。

Result: 在主动域适应任务中，LINGUAL实现了与传统主动学习基线相当或更优的性能，同时估计标注时间减少了约80%。

Conclusion: 语言指导的LINGUAL框架为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且认知负荷低的解决方案，显著提升了标注效率。

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉生成模型的快速发展，AI生成图像检测变得至关重要。作者希望研究一种无需训练的方法，利用自监督模型而不需要先验数据知识，避免为特定数据集训练检测器。

Method: WaRPAD首先定义基础评分函数，量化图像嵌入对通过Haar小波分解提取的高频方向扰动的敏感性。为了模拟裁剪增强的鲁棒性，将图像缩放到模型输入大小的倍数，分割成小块，计算每个块的基础评分，最后对所有块的评分进行平均得到最终检测分数。

Result: 在真实数据集和23种不同生成模型生成的图像上验证，WaRPAD始终实现竞争性性能，并表现出对测试时损坏的强大鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 由于对RandomResizedCrop的不变性是自监督模型的常见训练方案，WaRPAD可适用于各种自监督模型，提供了一种有效的无需训练AI生成图像检测解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

TL;DR: SCAR是一种基于自回归模型的语义上下文驱动图像编辑方法，通过压缩语义预填充和语义对齐指导来解决传统AR模型在图像编辑中的条件限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中表现出色，但在扩展到通用图像编辑时面临条件限制弱、效率低的问题，导致指令遵循性差和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出SCAR方法，包含两个关键组件：压缩语义预填充（将高级语义编码为紧凑高效的前缀）和语义对齐指导（在自回归解码过程中将最后视觉隐藏状态与目标语义对齐）。

Result: SCAR在指令编辑和可控生成基准测试中实现了卓越的视觉保真度和语义对齐，优于先前的基于AR的方法，同时保持了可控性。

Conclusion: SCAR方法克服了基于向量量化的预填充方法的语义限制和高成本问题，能够泛化到next-token和next-set两种AR范式，且只需最小的架构更改。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE提出了一种新的视觉token压缩方法，通过对象分割生成语义先验来指导token合并，创建紧凑的对象中心表示，同时使用质心排序机制保持空间信息，在多种压缩设置下达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时面临计算和内存成本过高的问题，现有token压缩方法缺乏高层次语义理解，导致次优合并、信息冗余或上下文丢失。

Method: 使用高效分割解码器生成对象掩码作为语义先验，指导视觉token合并为紧凑的对象中心表示，并引入质心引导排序机制恢复空间顺序。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中达到固定率压缩的最先进水平，在自适应率设置下实现显著效率提升，即使仅保留2.2%视觉token仍能维持97.4%的基线性能。

Conclusion: 对象中心表示在高效有效的LVLM处理中具有优越性，为视觉token压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分析中依赖大规模标注数据的瓶颈问题，特别是在罕见疾病等数据稀缺场景下，传统深度学习模型难以应用。

Method: 开发语义引导参数合成器(SGPS)，利用多模态任务信息(单张图像和临床文本描述)直接生成轻量级分类器的全部参数，无需任务特定训练。

Result: 在ISIC 2018皮肤病变数据集和自定义罕见疾病数据集上，1-shot和5-shot分类任务中显著优于现有少样本和零样本学习方法，建立新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 为AI驱动的诊断工具快速开发和部署提供了新范式，特别适用于数据极度有限的罕见疾病场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DEER-3D框架，通过错误驱动的3D场景编辑生成针对性反事实数据，解决3D-LLMs在语言到视觉空间元素精确接地方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D-LLMs在语言与3D环境视觉空间元素接地方面存在局限，主要由于训练数据侧重于语言推理而非空间理解，且缺乏3D资源导致固有接地偏见未解决。

Method: 采用DEER-3D框架，遵循"分解、诊断评估、编辑、重训练"工作流程。当识别到3D-LLM接地失败时，首先诊断具体的谓词级错误（如属性或空间关系），然后执行最小化、谓词对齐的3D场景编辑（如重新着色或重新定位），生成针对性反事实监督数据进行迭代模型微调。

Result: 在多个3D接地和场景理解任务的基准测试中评估编辑流程，通过迭代精炼在所有评估数据集上一致展示改进效果。

Conclusion: DEER-3D证明了针对性、错误驱动的场景编辑在弥合3D LLMs中语言推理能力与空间接地方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于二元交叉熵（BCE）的三方协同学习方法BCE3S，用于解决长尾识别任务中特征紧凑性、类别可分性和分类器平衡性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于交叉熵（CE）损失的长尾识别方法难以学习具有理想特性的特征，并且在Softmax分母中耦合了不平衡的分类器向量，放大了长尾识别中的不平衡效应。

Method: BCE3S包含三个组件：基于BCE的联合学习优化分类器和样本特征；基于BCE的对比学习进一步提高特征的类内紧凑性；基于BCE的均匀学习平衡分类器向量间的可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist2018等多个长尾数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BCE3S方法不仅实现了样本特征间更高的紧凑性和可分性，还平衡了分类器的可分性，在长尾识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

Motivation: 现有的All-in-One图像恢复方法通常依赖任务特定设计或潜在路由策略，难以适应真实世界中各种退化情况的复杂场景。需要开发一个统一且可解释的解决方案来处理多种退化问题。

Method: 1) 使用冻结的多模态大语言模型作为规划器分析退化图像并生成频率感知恢复计划；2) 在基于扩散的执行器中采用LoRA混合专家模块，动态选择高频或低频专家；3) 引入对抗训练和频率正则化损失来提升恢复质量并减少伪影。

Result: 在七个恢复任务上的广泛实验表明，FAPE-IR实现了最先进的性能，并在混合退化条件下表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将语义规划与基于频率的恢复相结合，FAPE-IR为All-in-One图像恢复提供了一个统一且可解释的解决方案，能够有效处理多种退化问题。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

TL;DR: RIVER是一个基于推理的隐式视频编辑模型，通过多跳推理解析用户隐式查询，无需精确的空间位置和时间边界描述即可编辑视频内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要用户提供精确的空间位置和时间边界描述，这在用户通过语义属性或对象关系的隐式查询进行编辑时变得不切实际。

Method: RIVER通过数字孪生表示解耦推理和生成，使用大语言模型进行多跳推理确定修改内容，然后输出结构化指令指导基于扩散的编辑器执行像素级修改。

Result: RIVER在提出的RVEBenchmark上表现最佳，并在VegGIE和FiVE两个额外视频编辑基准上达到最先进性能，超越了六个基线方法。

Conclusion: RIVER成功解决了推理视频编辑任务，能够通过多跳推理理解隐式查询并执行视频编辑，为更自然的人机交互提供了可能。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono是一种高效轻量的实时自监督单目深度估计方法，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理速度，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

Conclusion: 所提出的非对称聚合方法能够适应视觉位置识别中的分布差异，通过几何约束增强空间感知，显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Coffee提供了一种有效的可控微调方法，通过语言描述来防止模型学习不需要的概念，在保持模型性能的同时提高了微调的可控性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR成功将多视角视频数据转化为可操作的洞察，推进了车辆-基础设施协同系统的AI驱动交通安全分析。

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

### [42] [Attention Via Convolutional Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14137)
*Mingi Kang,Jeová Farias Sales Rocha Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ConvNN框架，将卷积和自注意力统一在k近邻聚合框架下，揭示了它们都是邻居选择和聚合的特殊情况：卷积基于空间邻近性选择邻居，注意力基于特征相似性选择邻居。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CNN和Transformer重塑了计算机视觉，但它们通常被视为根本不同的架构。作者认为卷积和自注意力尽管表面差异很大，但可以在统一的k近邻聚合框架下进行统一。

Method: 引入ConvNN框架，作为卷积层和注意力层的即插即用替代品，能够系统探索卷积和注意力之间的中间谱。在VGG和ViT架构上进行验证，包括混合分支和ConvNN变体。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100分类任务上验证：VGG混合分支提高了两个数据集的准确率；ViT中的ConvNN优于标准注意力和其他注意力变体。k值和架构变体的广泛消融实验显示，沿该谱插值通过平衡局部和全局感受野提供正则化益处。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一框架，消除了卷积和注意力之间的明显区别，对设计更原则化和可解释的视觉架构具有意义。

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出RiSe框架解决多模态人脸防伪中的跨域泛化问题，通过非对称不变风险最小化和多模态协同解耦，提升在未知攻击下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态人脸防伪方法在跨域部署时性能下降严重，主要由于两个被忽视的风险：模态表示不变性风险和模态协同不变性风险。前者因防伪任务中类别不对称性而加剧，后者因模型过度拟合域特定的模态间相关性。

Method: 提出RiSe框架：1) AsyIRM在径向空间学习不变球形决策边界以适应不对称分布；2) MMSD通过跨样本混合和解耦增强内在、可泛化的模态特征。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，RiSe在跨域性能上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: RiSe框架有效解决了多模态人脸防伪中的跨域泛化问题，通过处理表示和协同不变性风险，显著提升了在未知攻击下的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

Motivation: 现有鲁棒性基准主要关注文本幻觉或误导性文本输入，而忽视了误导性视觉输入对视觉理解评估的重要性。

Method: 基于基础视觉原语设计了三个层次的误导性视觉输入分类：视觉概念、视觉属性和视觉关系，构建了6个代表性类别和1,248个VQA实例。

Conclusion: MVI-Bench为开发更可靠和鲁棒的LVLM提供了可操作的见解，填补了现有基准的重要空白。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应令牌压缩方法有效减少了多模态大语言模型的计算负担，同时保持了高性能，与人类视觉认知系统一致。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

TL;DR: UniSER是一个通用模型，能够在一个框架内处理多种软效应退化问题，如镜头光晕、雾霾、阴影和反射等，通过大规模数据集和定制训练流程实现优于专业模型和通用模型的恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前处理图像软效应退化的方法多为针对单一问题的专业模型，缺乏可扩展性且未能利用这些恢复问题的共享本质。通用模型虽然功能强大，但在这些细粒度任务上往往需要详细提示且难以保持场景身份。

Method: 构建包含380万对图像的大规模数据集，填补公共基准的关键空白；定制训练流程，微调扩散变换器从多样化数据中学习鲁棒的恢复先验，集成细粒度掩码和强度控制。

Result: UniSER在野外环境中实现了鲁棒、高保真的恢复效果，显著优于专业模型和通用模型。

Conclusion: 通过利用软效应的共同本质（半透明遮挡），UniSER能够在单一框架内有效处理多种退化问题，展示了通用模型在图像恢复任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

TL;DR: GloTok提出了一种全局视角的图像分词器，通过代码本直方图关系学习和残差学习模块，实现更均匀的语义分布，从而提升图像重建和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分词方法采用局部监督的语义监督方式，限制了语义分布的均匀性。而VA-VAE证明更均匀的特征分布能带来更好的生成性能。

Method: 1. 代码本直方图关系学习方法：将预训练模型在整个数据集上建模的语义转移到语义代码本；2. 残差学习模块：恢复细粒度细节以最小化量化带来的重建误差。

Result: 在标准ImageNet-1k基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的重建性能和生成质量。

Conclusion: GloTok通过全局关系信息建模更均匀的语义分布，无需在训练过程中直接访问预训练模型，就能为自回归模型提供高质量的图像生成能力。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法在分割精度和效率方面均有显著改进，适用于实时临床应用，代码已公开。

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

Motivation: 高质量数据已成为规模定律下进展的主要驱动力，但现有的在线采样策略很少扩展到目标检测领域，因为其结构复杂性和领域差距。

Method: DetGain通过建模全局分数分布来高效估计全局AP变化，并计算师生贡献差距，在每次迭代中选择信息丰富的样本。该方法与架构无关且侵入性最小。

Conclusion: DetGain作为一种通用且互补的策略，在数据高效目标检测方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstantViR是一个基于预训练视频扩散先验的超快速视频重建框架，通过将双向视频扩散模型蒸馏为因果自回归学生模型，实现单次前向传播的实时视频恢复，在保持高质量的同时达到35+ FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频重建方法在实时性方面的不足：基于图像扩散的方法存在时间伪影，而原生视频扩散模型的迭代后验采样速度过慢，无法满足流媒体、远程呈现和AR/VR等实时应用需求。

Method: 将预训练的双向视频扩散模型（教师）蒸馏为因果自回归学生模型；采用先验驱动的蒸馏方法，仅需教师扩散模型和已知退化算子；使用LeanVAE替换视频扩散主干VAE，通过教师空间正则化蒸馏方案实现低延迟潜在空间处理。

Result: 在流式随机修复、高斯去模糊和超分辨率等任务中，InstantViR匹配或超越了基于扩散的基线方法的重建质量，在NVIDIA A100 GPU上运行速度超过35 FPS，比迭代视频扩散求解器快达100倍。

Conclusion: 基于扩散的视频重建可与实时、交互式、可编辑的流媒体场景兼容，使高质量视频恢复成为现代视觉系统的实用组件。

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Conclusion: WeSTAR框架通过弱监督自训练适应和正则化，有效提升了单目深度估计基础模型在未见领域的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯泼溅的低秩张量表示框架（GSLR），用于紧凑连续地表示多维图像，解决了传统t-SVD方法在捕捉局部高频信息方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统t-SVD方法存在两个关键限制：(1) 潜在张量近似粗糙，无法准确捕捉空间局部高频信息；(2) 变换矩阵由固定基原子组成，无法精确捕捉模式-3纤维上的局部高频信息。

Method: 使用定制的2D高斯泼溅生成潜在张量，1D高斯泼溅生成变换矩阵，两者在该表示框架中不可或缺且互补，具有强大的表示能力，特别是对局部高频信息。

Result: 在多个多维图像恢复实验中，GSLR始终优于最先进的方法，特别是在捕捉局部高频信息方面表现突出。

Conclusion: GSLR框架通过高斯泼溅技术有效解决了传统t-SVD方法的局限性，为多维图像表示提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到3D生成模型存在两个基本限制：难以捕捉细粒度提示细节的粗粒度语义对齐问题，以及缺乏稳健3D空间理解导致的几何不一致和部件组装失败问题。

Method: 提出VLM3D框架，重新利用大型视觉语言模型作为强大的可微分语义和空间评判器，核心贡献是基于VLM的是/否对数概率的双查询评判信号，评估语义保真度和几何一致性。

Result: VLM3D在两种不同范式上表现出通用性：作为优化管道的奖励目标，在标准基准上显著优于现有方法；作为前馈管道的测试时引导模块，主动纠正SOTA原生3D模型的严重空间错误。

Conclusion: VLM3D建立了一个原则性和可泛化的路径，将VLM丰富的基于语言理解的语义和空间知识注入到多样化的3D生成管道中。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机辅助骨科手术中，术前和术中数据的模态异质性使得配准具有挑战性且容易出错，需要鲁棒、自动和模态无关的骨表面配准方法。

Method: 提出NeuralBoneReg框架，包含两个模块：学习术前骨模型的隐式神经无符号距离场（UDF），以及基于MLP的配准模块，通过生成变换假设来对齐术中点云与神经UDF。

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的评估显示，NeuralBoneReg达到或超过现有方法，在UltraBones100k上平均RRE/RTE为1.68°/1.86 mm，在UltraBones-Hip上为1.88°/1.89 mm，在SpineDepth上为3.79°/2.45 mm。

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg在解剖结构和模态间表现出强大的泛化能力，为CAOS提供鲁棒准确的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF通过迭代细化能够逐步提高投影完整性和重建保真度，在超稀疏视角条件下实现高质量CT重建。

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

Result: 在34个专家标注的临床病例上评估，结果显示显著降低了标志点误差（特别是在后牙区域），下颌区域误差分布更集中，曲线级别的Chamfer距离和受控Hausdorff距离较低。

Conclusion: DentalSCR能够稳健处理真实世界头影测量X光片，提供高保真度、临床可检查的3D-2D对齐，优于传统基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARC-Chapter是首个在大规模长视频章节数据集上训练的模型，包含百万级双语、分层标注的视频章节，在视频章节划分任务上显著超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时长视频（如讲座、播客、纪录片）的普及，需要更高效的内容结构化方法。现有方法受限于小规模训练和粗粒度标注，难以泛化到长视频中的细微过渡。

Method: 通过结构化流程构建了双语英中章节数据集，统一了ASR转录、场景文本、视觉描述等多模态信息，形成从短标题到长摘要的多层次标注。设计了新的评估指标GRACE，考虑多对一段落重叠和语义相似性。

Result: ARC-Chapter在F1分数上比之前最佳方法提升14.0%，在SODA分数上提升11.3%。同时在下游任务如YouCook2上的密集视频描述任务中也提升了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 数据规模（数据量和标注强度）的提升带来明显性能改进，ARC-Chapter在视频章节划分任务上建立了新的最先进水平，并展现出优秀的可迁移性。

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像的3D高斯泼溅方法，通过结合标准3DGS渲染的基础颜色和从训练图像学习的残差，显著提升了渲染质量，特别是高频细节和视角相关效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅方法使用低阶球谐函数，难以捕捉空间变化的颜色和视角相关效果（如镜面高光）。现有方法要么使用全局纹理图（难以处理复杂场景），要么使用每个高斯的纹理图（存储开销大）。

Method: 提出Image-Based Gaussian Splatting方法，将每个像素颜色建模为标准3DGS渲染的基础颜色与从邻近训练图像学习的残差的组合，利用高分辨率源图像进行精细细节和视角特定颜色建模。

Result: 在标准NVS基准测试中，该方法在渲染质量上显著优于先前的Gaussian Splatting方法，且不增加存储占用。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合基础渲染和学习残差，实现了高质量的高频细节和准确视角相关效果渲染，是3D高斯泼溅的有效改进方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Abstract: Blinking is a vital physiological process that protects and maintains the health of the ocular surface. Objective assessment of eyelid movements remains challenging due to the complexity, cost, and limited clinical applicability of existing tools. This study presents the clinical validation of Bapp (Blink Application), a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework and integrated with Google ML Kit for on-device, real-time analysis of eyelid movements. The validation occurred using 45 videos from real patients, whose blinks were manually annotated by ophthalmology specialists from the Paulista School of Medicine of the Federal University of Sao Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) to serve as the ground truth. Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国际生物特征身份证件标准要求严格的姿态合规性，但现有自动化质量评估方法缺乏针对肩部姿态的定量评估方法

Method: 使用常见姿态估计框架提供的两个肩部标志点的3D坐标，量化肩部偏转和滚动角度

Result: 在121张肖像图像数据集上评估，SPE得分与人工标注显示出强相关性（皮尔逊相关系数约0.80），过滤性能分析证实了识别不合规样本的有效性

Conclusion: 该算法是注册系统中自动合规检查的可行轻量级工具

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击主要针对单目感知系统，使用2D补丁攻击，而针对立体双目深度估计的物理对抗攻击效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出3D物理对抗示例，采用全局伪装纹理；开发3D立体匹配渲染模块处理相机视差效应；提出新颖的融合攻击方法，通过细粒度优化将目标无缝融入环境。

Result: 广泛评估表明，该方法能成功欺骗立体模型产生错误的深度信息，相比现有隐藏攻击具有显著增强的隐蔽性和杀伤力。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了针对立体视觉系统的物理对抗攻击的可行性，为自动驾驶系统的安全性提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0是一个新的数据集，用于从视频中推断3D人体运动，特别是在世界坐标系中估计人体运动。它比BEDLAM数据集在相机运动、人体形状、动作、服装、头发、3D环境和鞋子等方面更加多样化和真实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视频中推断3D人体运动是一个具有挑战性的问题，特别是在存在人体和相机运动的情况下。传统方法在图像坐标系中估计人体，但许多应用需要世界坐标系中的人体运动估计。该领域进展受限的主要原因是缺乏包含真实人体和相机运动的地面真实数据的丰富视频数据。

Method: 通过创建BEDLAM2.0数据集来解决这个问题。该数据集在BEDLAM基础上增加了更多多样化和真实的相机和相机运动，提高了人体形状、动作、服装、头发和3D环境的多样性和真实性，并添加了BEDLAM中缺失的鞋子。

Result: BEDLAM2.0显著优于BEDLAM，特别是在训练估计世界坐标系中人体运动的方法方面。比较在BEDLAM和BEDLAM2.0上训练的最先进方法，发现BEDLAM2.0显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0是一个重要的资源，用于训练3D人体姿态和运动回归器，特别是在世界坐标系中估计人体运动方面。它提供了渲染的视频、地面真实人体参数和相机运动，以及3D资产和第三方链接，供研究使用。

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

Conclusion: LAVA通过语言锚定的相对对齐方法有效解决了领域增量学习中的核心挑战，实现了跨领域的知识保留和重用。

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Motivation: 解决传统单查询文本到图像检索方法在可控性和容错性方面的不足，通过交互式对话提供更精确的图像搜索体验。

Method: 提出DIR-TIR框架，包含两个核心模块：对话精炼模块主动向用户提问提取关键信息生成精确描述；图像精炼模块识别生成图像与用户意图之间的感知差距，减少视觉语义差异。

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的综合实验表明，该对话驱动方法显著优于仅使用初始描述的基线方法，模块协同集成实现了更高的检索精度和更好的交互体验。

Conclusion: DIR-TIR框架通过多轮对话机制提供了优于传统方法的可控性和容错性，在交互式文本到图像检索任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

Conclusion: 残差学习设计结合物理约束能够产生空间连贯、物理合理的床地形，适用于领域偏移下的操作制图。

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于解码器的参数感知Mamba模型(PAMM)，利用状态空间模型的丰富参数来增强多任务密集预测中的任务互联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解任务间的相互关系和交互对于多任务密集预测至关重要。现有方法主要使用卷积层和注意力机制探索任务级交互，但需要更有效的方法来建模任务间关系。

Method: PAMM采用双状态空间参数专家来集成和设置任务特定参数先验，通过结构化状态空间序列模型(S4)全局整合任务先验，并使用多方向希尔伯特扫描方法构建多角度特征序列。

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PAMM框架能够有效增强多任务密集预测中的任务互联性，通过状态空间模型参数实现精确的多任务交互。

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

TL;DR: D-PerceptCT是一种受人类视觉系统启发的LDCT图像增强架构，通过视觉双路径提取器和全局-局部状态空间块，结合深度感知相关性损失函数，有效提升低剂量CT图像质量并保留关键诊断细节。

Motivation: 低剂量CT图像质量较差，现有方法容易过度平滑导致关键细节丢失，需要开发能够保留感知相关特征的增强方法。

Method: 提出D-PerceptCT架构，包含视觉双路径提取器（集成预训练DINOv2模型的语义先验）和全局-局部状态空间块，并设计深度感知相关性损失函数。

Result: 在Mayo2016数据集上的实验表明，D-PerceptCT相比现有最优方法能更好地保留LDCT图像的结构和纹理信息。

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT通过模拟人类视觉系统原理，成功实现了LDCT图像的感知增强，为放射科医生提供了包含关键解剖结构和病理细节的清晰CT图像。

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

Motivation: 现有的视频变分自编码器通常忽略帧内容之间的相似性，导致潜在建模冗余。

Method: 将视频内容分解为关键帧、运动和残差三个组件，为每个组件设计专用编码器，使用共享的3D解码器进行重建，并采用解耦适应策略进行稳定训练。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性实验表明，DeCo-VAE实现了卓越的视频重建性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式解耦视频内容并学习专门的潜在表示，DeCo-VAE能够实现紧凑的潜在表示和高质量的视频重建。

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

Method: 采用三模态融合框架：RGB分支提取全局视觉不一致性，纹理分支检测细粒度融合伪影，频率分支识别周期性频谱噪声；使用注意力机制进行时序池化和自适应融合。

Result: 在Celeb-DF数据集上，AUC达到0.9752，F1-Score为0.9408，准确率为0.9208，显著优于单流基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合提供了对细微伪造的优越鲁棒性，消融实验验证了分支协同作用，Grad-CAM确认了取证关注点。

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Conclusion: 该方法能够以更紧凑的潜表示恢复更多高保真几何细节，为多个SDF的表示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

Result: 实现了3.42倍推理加速和1.4倍内存减少，同时保持性能，无需训练。

Conclusion: OmniZip有效解决了多模态令牌压缩问题，显著提升了推理效率，为音频-视频理解任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Motivation: 现有WMH自动分割方法大多只提供全局病变负荷，忽视了不同白质区域的空间分布，需要开发能够准确定位和量化区域WMH的方法。

Method: 使用深度学习框架进行稳健的WMH分割和定位，在公共数据集和ADNI队列中评估，量化解剖定义区域内的WMH负荷，并结合脑结构体积评估诊断价值。

Conclusion: 区域WMH量化具有附加价值，将局部病变指标与萎缩标志物结合可能增强神经退行性疾病的早期诊断和分层能力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Conclusion: 临床特征在识别高风险极端病例方面表现优异，而基于Transformer的MRI嵌入对稳定性细微标记更敏感，这推动了AD进展建模中多模态融合策略的发展。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

Result: 模型在模拟数据集上比基线ST-GCN提升5.32%和2.91% F1分数，但零样本泛化到未见受试者时性能降至35.9%。

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Result: 在DTU、BlendedMVS和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在稀疏视图场景下重建更准确和详细的表面，同时保持高质量的新视角渲染性能，有效解决了现有方法在稀疏监督下的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLAM-AGS是一个面向计算细胞学的预训练框架，通过联合优化弱监督相似性目标和自监督对比目标，解决了实例级标签不可靠和目击率极低的问题，在低目击率下显著提升了下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算细胞学面临两个主要挑战：实例级标签不可靠且获取成本高昂，目击率极低。需要开发能够在低目击率下稳定学习的方法。

Method: 提出SLAM-AGS框架，联合优化弱监督相似性目标（在幻灯片负补丁上）和自监督对比目标（在幻灯片正补丁上），应用自适应梯度手术解决任务梯度冲突，并将预训练编码器集成到基于注意力的多实例学习聚合器中。

Result: 在公开骨髓细胞学数据集上，模拟目击率从10%到0.5%，SLAM-AGS在袋级F1分数和Top 400阳性细胞检索方面优于其他预训练方法，在低目击率下增益最大。

Conclusion: 解决梯度干扰能够实现稳定的预训练，并在下游任务中获得更好的性能，特别是在低目击率场景下。

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.

Motivation: 传统视网膜血管分割方法仅关注空间信息，忽略了多普勒全息数据的时间丰富性，需要准确分割视网膜动静脉以评估视网膜血流动力学。

Method: 使用标准分割架构，结合专用脉冲分析流程提取的特征，使传统U-Net能够利用时间动态信息进行动静脉分割。

Conclusion: 时间分辨预处理为定量探索视网膜血流动力学开辟了新视角，数据集已在HuggingFace平台公开。

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

*William Guo,Adaku Uchendu,Ana Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型文本水印技术的鲁棒性和质量保持能力，发现现有水印技术虽然能保持语义，但会偏离原始文本的写作风格，且容易受到对抗攻击，特别是回译攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减轻大型语言模型生成文本的潜在危害，研究人员提出了水印技术。然而，这些技术往往会影响生成文本的质量，且容易受到对抗攻击，导致文本可能逃避检测，这阻碍了水印技术在LLM创作者中的广泛采用。

Method: 通过比较改写和回译（英语→其他语言→英语）两种对抗攻击方式，评估多种水印技术的鲁棒性；使用语言指标来评估水印技术在保持未加水印文本质量和写作风格方面的能力。

Result: 研究结果表明，这些水印技术能够保持语义，但会偏离未加水印文本的写作风格，并且容易受到对抗攻击，特别是回译攻击。

Conclusion: 当前的水印技术在保持语义方面表现良好，但在写作风格保持和对抗攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，需要进一步改进以促进其在LLM中的广泛应用。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种无需训练的方法用于WMT 2025自动翻译质量评估任务：QE-informed重翻译和基于QE解释的错误替换方法，前者通过选择多LLM候选中的最佳翻译获得优胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然联合训练QE和APE系统能提升性能，但APE系统存在过度校正问题，导致性能下降。本文研究无需训练的简单方法来避免这一问题。

Method: 方法一：QE-informed重翻译，从不同LLM生成的多个候选翻译中选择质量最高的；方法二：基于QE解释的错误替换，根据提供的QE解释指导LLM替换错误子串，采用条件启发式最小化编辑次数。

Result: 两种方法的Delta COMET得分分别为0.0201和-0.0108，方法一在子任务排行榜上获得优胜位置。

Conclusion: 无需训练的QE-informed重翻译方法在WMT 2025任务中表现优于基于QE解释的错误替换方法，证明了选择多LLM候选翻译策略的有效性。

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在检索应用中存在的'迷失在中间'现象，即模型难以有效利用长距离上下文信息的问题，这在基于检索的LLM应用中是一个重要挑战。

Method: 引入GM-Extract基准数据集，提出使用文档指标（空间检索能力）和变量提取指标（语义检索能力）的双重评估系统，对7-8B参数模型在多文档任务上进行系统评估，并对缓解方法进行文献调研和分类。

Result: 发现数据表示方式会显著改变检索性能，虽然没有一致观察到明显的U形曲线，但模型性能呈现清晰模式且与困惑度得分相关。缓解方法的效果具有高度复杂性，在某些情况下能成功提升性能，但在其他情况下会产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对'迷失在中间'现象在实际应用中的全面理解，强调了缓解策略效用的复杂性，为改进检索型LLM应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的框架，用于解析电商搜索查询中的最高级表达（如"最好"、"最受欢迎"），通过提取结构化提示来改进搜索性能，同时解决了LLM直接重排的延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索中带有最高级的查询需要跨多个维度比较候选商品，这需要语言理解和领域知识，而传统方法难以有效处理这类语义复杂的查询。

Method: 开发了一个框架，将查询分解为属性-值提示，这些提示与检索过程并行生成，然后将最高级解释转移到轻量级模型以实现高效部署。

Result: 方法在MAP上提高了10.9个点，在MRR上提高了5.9个点，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何表示和传递最高级语义，在解决实际部署约束的同时，推进了检索系统中的语言理解能力。

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOC虚假信息检测方法过于强调内部一致性，忽略了图像-文本对与外部证据之间的外部一致性的重要性。

Method: 提出分层证据增强生成框架HiEAG，将外部一致性检查分解为检索、重排序和重写的综合引擎流程，使用AESP进行证据重排序，AEGP进行证据重写。

Result: 在不同基准数据集上的实验结果表明，HiEAG在所有样本的准确率上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: HiEAG框架通过分层证据增强生成有效改进了多模态虚假信息检测的外部一致性检查，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

Conclusion: 提出的平衡数据集和增强模型方法有效解决了多标签情感分类中的类别不平衡问题，显著提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 推理增强视觉语言模型依赖安全对齐来防止有害行为，但其暴露的思维链轨迹引入了新的攻击面。研究发现这些模型的安全对齐很容易被突破。

Method: 采用Stealth Fine-Tuning方法，通过分段干扰引发有害推理轨迹，并将自生成输出作为监督微调数据，使用轮次加权损失设计实现轻量级、分布一致的微调。

Result: 在实验中，该方法仅用499个样本和单张A100显卡3小时训练（使用QLoRA），攻击成功率比IDEATOR高出38.52%，同时保持通用推理能力，模型保持了原始表示分布。

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning是一种低成本且高效的方法，能够有效绕过对齐防御，在AdvBench和多个通用基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本自动ICD编码面临极端长尾分布挑战，数千个罕见和零样本ICD代码在MIMIC-III等数据集中严重不足，导致宏观F1分数较低。

Method: 构建基于罕见代码的现实多标签代码集，利用真实世界共现模式、ICD描述、同义词、分类法和相似临床笔记生成结构化提示，产生90,000个合成笔记覆盖7,902个ICD代码。

Result: 在PLM-ICD和GKI-ICD模型上的实验表明，该方法适度提高了宏观F1分数，同时保持强大的微观F1性能，优于先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 虽然相对于计算成本增益可能看似边际，但精心设计的合成数据可以增强长尾ICD代码预测的公平性。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

Conclusion: 选择性弱到强泛化有助于实现超对齐，能够有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

### [109] [SymLoc: Symbolic Localization of Hallucination across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14172)
*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个基于符号语言学知识的幻觉定位框架，通过分析符号触发词（如修饰语、否定、数字等）在模型各层的处理过程，揭示幻觉的根本原因是符号语言处理失败而非一般生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在遇到符号触发词时仍存在幻觉问题，但缺乏对这些符号幻觉起源的清晰理解，需要系统性地处理这些触发词并定位模型内部的幻觉产生位置。

Method: 提出符号定位框架，利用符号语言学和语义知识来追踪幻觉在所有模型层的发展，重点关注模型如何处理符号触发词，使用HaluEval和TruthfulQA分析五个模型。

Result: 符号知识方法显示，这些语言元素的注意力方差在早期层（2-4层）爆炸性增长到临界不稳定状态，否定触发灾难性方差水平，符号语义处理从一开始就崩溃。尽管模型规模更大，幻觉率仍保持高位（78.3%-83.7%），深层中符号语义触发词的注意力急剧下降。

Conclusion: 幻觉本质上是符号语言处理失败，而非一般生成问题，符号语义知识为理解和定位LLMs中的幻觉机制提供了关键见解。

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

*Jiajun Hou,Chenyu Zhang,Rui Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepEL是一个将大语言模型深度集成到实体链接各个阶段的框架，通过自验证机制利用全局上下文信息来改进实体消歧，在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将大语言模型应用于实体链接的孤立阶段，未能充分发挥其在整个流程中的潜力，且孤立消歧实体不足以获得最优性能。

Method: 提出DeepEL框架，将大语言模型集成到实体链接的每个阶段，并引入基于全局上下文信息的自验证机制，使模型能够修正自身预测并识别同一句子中实体间的连贯关系。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的评估显示，DeepEL显著优于现有最先进方法，整体F1分数平均提升2.6%，在领域外数据集上获得4%的显著提升。

Conclusion: 深度集成大语言模型能有效推进实体链接技术的前沿发展，自验证机制通过利用全局上下文信息显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.

*Ahlam Alrehili,Areej Alhothali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ArbESC+系统，这是首个针对阿拉伯语语法错误校正的多系统方法，通过组合多个模型来提升校正效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语具有复杂的形态和句法结构，比其它语言更具挑战性。虽然现代神经模型已有很大改进，但先前研究大多使用单一模型，未充分利用多系统组合的潜在优势。

Method: 使用多个模型（AraT5、ByT5、mT5、AraBART等）收集校正建议，并将其表示为数值特征。基于这些特征，分类器确定并实施适当的校正。框架还使用支持技术过滤重叠校正并评估决策可靠性。

Result: 多模型组合比单一模型表现更好，在QALB-14测试数据上F0.5达到82.63%，在QALB-15 L1数据上达到84.64%，在QALB-15 L2数据上达到65.55%。

Conclusion: 这是首个整合阿拉伯语语言错误校正的尝试，改进现有模型为开发先进的阿拉伯语文本处理工具提供了实用步骤，将有益于阿拉伯语用户和研究者。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

Conclusion: 这项工作在正确的语料库和正确的目标方面都取得了进展，为音乐领域构建领域LLM提供了可扩展的数据训练框架和可重用的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

*Rui Liu,Yuan Zhao,Zhenqi Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Authentic-Dubber模型，通过检索增强的导演-演员交互学习方案，模拟真实电影配音工作流程，提升情感表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电影配音方法简化了工作流程，忽略了导演与演员之间的关键互动环节，而真实工作流程中导演会指导演员内化情感上下文线索。

Method: 构建多模态参考片段库，使用基于情感相似性的检索增强策略，开发渐进式图基语音生成方法，逐步整合检索到的多模态情感知识。

Result: 在V2C Animation基准数据集上的主客观评估验证了有效性，实现了情感表现力的全面提升。

Conclusion: Authentic-Dubber能够忠实复制真实配音工作流程，显著提升配音的情感表达质量。

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决心理健康资源获取障碍，为研究提供合成治疗对话数据，通过AI技术扩大心理健康服务的可及性。

Method: 系统集成三个组件：RAG对话助手提供个性化知识对话；合成治疗对话生成器基于用户档案生成数据；AI健康规划器使用CrewAI创建动态自护计划。

Result: 在精心设计的健康场景中评估RAG助手，使用自动LLM判断和用户研究，展示了系统功能性和有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了NLP研究者与心理健康专业人士跨学科合作的机会，推动人机交互在健康领域的负责任创新。

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

TL;DR: AfriSpeech-MultiBench是首个针对非洲英语口音的领域特定评估套件，涵盖10+国家、100多种口音和7个应用领域，评估了多种语音识别系统在非洲语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音AI技术快速发展，但缺乏针对非洲语言多样性的公开应用特定模型评估，需要为非洲使用场景提供专门的语音技术评估工具。

Method: 构建包含自发和非自发语音对话的综合评估套件，涵盖金融、法律、医疗等7个应用领域，对开源、专有、单模态和多模态语音识别系统进行基准测试。

Result: 开源ASR在自发语音中表现良好但在嘈杂非母语对话中退化；多模态LLM对口音更鲁棒但在领域特定命名实体上表现不佳；专有模型在清晰语音中准确率高但随国家和领域变化显著。

Conclusion: 非洲英语微调的模型在延迟和准确性方面具有竞争优势，但幻觉问题仍是大多数SOTA模型的挑战，该基准有助于为非洲社区选择适合的语音技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

### [116] [Entropy-Guided Reasoning Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14258)
*Hourun Zhu,Yang Gao,Wenlong Fei,Jiawei Li,Huashan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种熵引导的训练框架来解决大型推理模型在压缩训练过程中的熵冲突问题，将推理长度压缩到原始的20%同时保持或提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法忽视了训练过程中的熵冲突现象：压缩目标降低熵导致推理变短但探索受限，而性能目标增加熵导致推理链变长，使模型陷入局部困境。

Method: 采用熵引导的训练框架，在熵下降时引导模型进行简洁推理，在熵上升时在紧凑推理模式下增强探索以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试上的实验表明，该方法将推理长度压缩到原始的20%，同时保持甚至超过了基线准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的熵引导训练框架有效解决了压缩训练中的熵冲突问题，实现了推理长度的大幅压缩且不损失性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过预测语言化概率分布来改进LLM置信度估计的方法，该方法通过要求模型考虑答案空间中的所有候选答案并仔细分配置信度分数，从而鼓励深度推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解模型响应的可靠性在应用中至关重要。虽然已有研究关注生成语言化置信度，并结合思维链推理提供逻辑透明的估计，但推理策略如何影响置信度估计仍未充分探索。

Method: 提出预测语言化概率分布的方法，要求LLM考虑答案空间中的所有候选答案而非单一猜测，并仔细分配置信度分数以满足分布要求。

Result: 该方法在不同模型和任务中均显示出优势，无论答案空间是否已知。即使在强化学习后仍保持优势，进一步分析显示其推理模式与人类期望一致。

Conclusion: 预测语言化概率分布能有效鼓励深度推理进行置信度估计，在多种场景下表现出优越性能，且推理模式符合人类认知。

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前阿拉伯语和双语大型语言模型在表面水平上表现出色，但在深层语法和句法推理方面存在困难，需要专门的基准测试来评估其真实的语言学能力。

Method: 通过150个专家设计的多项选择题，直接评估结构语言理解能力，对35个阿拉伯语和双语大型语言模型进行系统评估。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在表面水平上表现良好，但在深层语法和句法推理方面存在困难，许多模型通过记忆或模式识别而非真实理解来获得高分。

Conclusion: AraLingBench通过分离和测量基础语言技能，为开发阿拉伯语大型语言模型提供了诊断框架，突显了基于知识的基准测试高分与真实语言掌握之间的持续差距。

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注LLMs如何遵循用户指令，但忽略了指令包含冲突约束的常见场景，LLMs在这种条件下的行为研究不足。

Method: 引入ConInstruct基准数据集，评估LLMs的冲突检测性能并分析其冲突解决行为。

Result: 专有LLMs冲突检测能力强，开源模型中仅DeepSeek-R1表现类似；DeepSeek-R1和Claude-4.5-Sonnet分别获得91.5%和87.3%的平均F1分数；LLMs很少明确通知用户冲突或请求澄清。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在处理冲突约束时存在关键缺陷，这是设计指令遵循LLMs时需要改进的重要领域。

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文提出标准化上下文校准（NCC）方法，解决大语言模型中多标记类别标签引起的标签长度偏差问题，在多个数据集和模型上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在预测候选选项时存在标签偏差，现有校准方法忽略了多标记类别标签带来的偏差，特别是标签长度不一致导致的预测不一致问题。

Method: 提出标准化上下文校准（NCC），在全标签级别进行标准化和校准，通过上下文学习结合偏差缓解，减少对少样本示例选择的敏感性。

Result: NCC在多个数据集和模型上取得统计显著的改进，F1分数提升高达10%，在多项选择题回答等任务中扩展了偏差缓解能力。

Conclusion: 缓解全标签偏差对于提高基于LLM方法的性能和鲁棒性至关重要，特别是在类别标签自然包含多个标记的实际应用中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

TL;DR: 提出了EduHarm基准测试和TSSF三阶段防护框架，用于保护教育场景中的大语言模型免受越狱攻击和微调攻击，同时保持对良性查询的正常处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在教育应用中面临越狱攻击和微调攻击的威胁，现有研究主要关注通用安全评估，缺乏针对教育场景独特安全需求的专门解决方案。

Method: 构建EduHarm基准测试，提出三阶段防护框架：安全感知注意力重对齐、分层安全判断、防御驱动的双路由机制，同时防御越狱和微调攻击。

Result: 在八种越狱攻击策略上有效增强安全性，防止对良性查询的过度拒绝；在三个微调攻击数据集上实现稳健防御，同时保持良性微调带来的效用增益。

Conclusion: TSSF框架为教育大语言模型提供了有效的安全防护，能够同时应对越狱和微调攻击，在保障安全性的同时维持模型实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

TL;DR: MedBench v4是一个全国性的云基准测试平台，包含超过70万个专家策划的医疗任务，评估了15个前沿模型。基础LLM平均得分54.1/100，但安全性和伦理得分较低；多模态模型表现更差；基于相同骨干的智能体显著提升端到端性能至79.8/100。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗大语言模型、多模态模型和智能体的发展，需要能够反映真实临床工作流程和安全约束的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含70万+专家策划任务的云基准测试基础设施，涵盖24个主要专科和91个次要专科，采用多阶段精炼和多轮临床医生评审，使用LLM作为评分器校准人类评分。

Result: 基础LLM平均得分54.1/100（最佳：Claude Sonnet 4.5，62.5/100），安全性和伦理得分仅18.4/100；多模态模型平均47.5/100（最佳：GPT-5，54.9/100）；智能体显著提升至79.8/100，基于Claude Sonnet 4.5的智能体达到85.3/100。

Conclusion: MedBench v4揭示了基础模型在多模态推理和安全性方面的持续差距，同时表明具有治理意识的智能体编排可以显著提升临床准备度而不牺牲能力，为医院、开发者和政策制定者提供实用参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Method: 研究声明集对齐技术，通过识别最佳对齐和评估方法来计算声明集之间的相似度得分，作为模型提取性能的评估指标。

Result: 实验揭示了当前评估方法在文档级声明提取中的局限性，特别是在处理非正式语言、强本地语境和语言细微差别时的不足。

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

TL;DR: 本研究使用电子健康记录数据，通过聚类分析识别急性肾损伤（AKI）患者的不同临床状态，并采用多状态模型估计向慢性肾病（CKD）进展的风险，发现15种不同的AKI后状态，每种状态具有不同的CKD发展概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AKI患者发展为CKD的风险很高，但识别高风险患者仍然具有挑战性。本研究旨在通过数据驱动的方法动态追踪AKI患者的临床演变，并表征AKI向CKD的进展过程。

Method: 使用电子健康记录数据，通过纵向医疗代码和肌酐测量值聚类识别AKI后临床状态，采用多状态模型估计状态间转换概率和CKD进展风险，通过生存分析识别AKI亚群中的CKD风险因素。

Result: 在20,699名入院时患有AKI的患者中，3,491名（17%）发展为CKD。识别出15种不同的AKI后状态，每种状态具有不同的CKD发展概率。75%的患者在研究期间保持单一状态或仅进行一次转换。确定了传统和新型CKD风险因素，其影响在不同临床状态间存在差异。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种数据驱动的方法来识别高风险AKI患者，支持开发用于早期CKD检测和干预的决策支持工具。

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

TL;DR: 本文比较了人类标注与多种大语言模型在政治偏见检测中的表现，发现RoBERTa与人类标注最一致，GPT在零样本设置下表现最佳，强调需要结合人类可解释性和模型可扩展性的混合评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP技术已能自动分类政治偏见，但大语言模型与人类判断的一致性程度仍未被充分探索和理解，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建手动标注的新闻文章数据集，评估标注一致性、偏见极性和模型间一致性，量化人类与模型对偏见感知的差异，比较GPT、BERT、RoBERTa和FLAN等模型。

Result: 传统基于transformer的模型中，RoBERTa与人类标签对齐度最高；生成模型如GPT在零样本设置下与人类标注总体一致性最强；微调的RoBERTa模型在所有基线中获得最高准确率和最强的人类标注对齐度。

Conclusion: 人类与LLMs在感知政治倾向方面存在系统性差异，需要在自动化媒体偏见检测中结合人类可解释性和模型可扩展性的混合评估框架。

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

Motivation: 当前先进视觉语言模型在逻辑推理、问题解决等方面表现出色，但在空间推理这一人类认知基础能力上仍面临重大挑战，特别是涉及心理旋转、导航和空间关系理解等任务。

Method: 引入SpatiaLite合成基准测试，联合测量空间推理准确性和效率；提出Imagery Driven Framework用于数据合成和训练，构建内部世界模型。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：1）先进VLMs主要依赖语言表示，在视觉中心任务上表现不足；2）空间推理机制效率低下，token使用随复杂度快速增长；3）IDF框架能隐式构建内部世界模型。

Conclusion: 本研究明确了先进VLMs的空间推理局限性和模式，识别了关键缺陷，并为未来改进提供了方向，强调了构建内部世界模型对空间推理的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CORGI的新匹配算法，用于解决规则系统中指数级时间和空间消耗的问题，特别适用于实时AI系统和数据库查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时AI系统和数据库查询中的规则匹配可能面临指数级时间和空间需求，特别是在处理具有多个未约束变量的规则时。自动生成的规则容易产生最坏情况匹配模式，导致程序执行缓慢或内存溢出。

Method: CORGI采用两步法：前向传递构建/维护接地关系图，后向迭代器按需生成匹配。与传统RETE方法不同，CORGI没有传统的β-内存来收集部分匹配，而是通过迭代流式传输后续匹配。

Result: 性能评估显示，在简单组合匹配任务上，CORGI显著优于SOAR和OPS5中的RETE实现。

Conclusion: CORGI为规则匹配系统提供了二次时间和空间保证，能够避免高延迟延迟和内存溢出问题，使在线AI系统在实际应用中更加可行。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Motivation: 由于难以捕捉实际发生的事故触发场景，获取工作场所危险检测所需的真实图像数据集存在困难。

Method: 使用GPT-4o分析OSHA叙述提取结构化危险推理，转换为对象级场景图，指导文本到图像扩散模型生成构图准确的危险场景，并引入VQA框架评估生成数据。

Result: 提出的VQA图分数在四个最先进的生成模型上，基于熵验证优于CLIP和BLIP指标，证实其具有更高的判别敏感性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效合成基于历史事故报告的真实危险场景图像，为工作场所安全检测提供了可行的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

TL;DR: ALEX是一个轻量级知识编辑框架，通过分层内存架构将知识更新组织成语义聚类，将检索复杂度从O(N)降低到O(K+N/C)，显著提高了多跳问答的准确性和推理路径的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应不断变化的信息，现有方法在处理需要多步推理的复杂多跳问题时面临可扩展性和检索效率的挑战。

Method: ALEX采用分层内存架构组织知识更新，包含推理查询合成模块来弥合查询与事实之间的语义鸿沟，以及动态证据裁决引擎执行高效的两阶段检索过程。

Result: 在MQUAKE基准测试中，ALEX显著提高了多跳答案的准确性和推理路径的可靠性，同时将所需搜索空间减少了80%以上。

Conclusion: ALEX为构建可扩展、高效和准确的知识编辑系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

TL;DR: Syn-STARTS是一个使用LLMs生成分类病例的框架，在质量上与手动整理的TRIAGE开放数据集难以区分，为开发高性能医疗AI模型提供了合成数据的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件中的分类决策至关重要，但真实数据难以收集，需要开发合成数据生成方法以支持AI模型开发。

Method: 开发Syn-STARTS框架，使用LLMs生成分类病例，并与手动整理的TRIAGE数据集进行质量对比验证。

Result: 生成的分类病例在质量上与手动数据集难以区分，在绿色、黄色、红色和黑色类别的评估中表现出高度稳定性。

Conclusion: 合成数据在开发严重和关键医疗情况的高性能AI模型方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应学习系统诊断精确但干预薄弱，导致帮助时机不当或内容不匹配。需要建立诊断与教学之间的闭环，提供公平且可扩展的个性化学习。

Method: 将干预分配形式化为带约束的二元整数规划，包括覆盖度、时间、难度窗口、先决条件和反冗余约束。采用贪婪选择、梯度松弛和混合方法三种求解器。

Result: 在1204名学生的物理课程部署中，两种求解器都能在有限观看时间内实现几乎所有学习者的完整技能覆盖。梯度方法比贪婪方法减少约12%的冗余覆盖，并更好地协调难度。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一个可追踪和可审计的控制器，闭合了诊断-教学循环，在课堂规模上实现了公平且负载感知的个性化学习。

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

TL;DR: PathMind是一个新颖的知识图谱推理框架，通过选择性引导LLMs使用重要推理路径来增强忠实和可解释的推理，采用"检索-优先排序-推理"范式，在复杂推理任务上表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGR方法存在两个关键限制：1）不加区分地提取推理路径，可能引入误导性噪声；2）动态探索推理路径需要高检索需求和频繁LLM调用。

Method: PathMind采用"检索-优先排序-推理"范式：1）通过检索模块从KG中检索查询子图；2）引入路径优先排序机制，使用语义感知路径优先级函数识别重要推理路径；3）通过双阶段训练策略生成准确响应。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PathMind始终优于竞争基线，特别是在复杂推理任务上，通过识别基本推理路径，使用更少的输入token实现更好性能。

Conclusion: PathMind通过选择性引导LLMs使用重要推理路径，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在知识图谱推理任务中实现了更忠实和可解释的推理性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Motivation: 移动应用页面布局设计耗时且需要专业技能，现有设计软件使用复杂且跨页面协作效率低，需要自动化解决方案来提升设计效率。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，包含OrchestratorAgent（协调）、SemanticParserAgent（语义解析）、PrimaryLayoutAgent（初始布局）、TemplateRetrievalAgent（模板检索）和RecursiveComponentAgent（递归组件生成），通过智能体协作完成页面设计任务。

Result: 在RICO数据集上的实验结果表明，APD-agents达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该工作充分利用了大模型驱动的多智能体系统的自动协作能力，为移动应用页面设计提供了高效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型是否真正理解时间顺序，因为金融和经济应用中经常需要处理时间序列数据，而模型对时间顺序的理解直接影响其应用的可靠性。

Method: 设计了一系列时间顺序任务，包括时间排序、条件排序（先过滤后排序）和时代错误检测，评估了GPT-4.1、Claude-3.7 Sonnet和GPT-5在不同推理努力设置下的表现。

Result: 随着序列长度增加，精确匹配率急剧下降，但排名相关性保持较高；条件排序中大多数失败来自过滤步骤；时代错误检测是最简单的任务但性能仍会下降；GPT-5在中等/高推理努力下能实现完美排序。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在时间顺序任务上存在局限性，分配明确的推理预算有助于提升性能，这对金融领域的实时应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

Motivation: Whisper模型在噪声声学条件下经常出现幻觉错误，而现有方法主要关注音频预处理或转录后处理，对模型本身的修改研究较少。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过自适应层注意力机制增强编码器鲁棒性，将编码器层分组为语义连贯的块；第二阶段使用多目标知识蒸馏框架，在噪声音频上训练学生模型，使其语义和注意力分布与处理干净输入的教师模型对齐。

Result: 在噪声语音基准测试中，幻觉错误和词错误率显著降低，同时在干净语音上保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 自适应层注意力和知识蒸馏相结合，为提升Whisper模型在真实世界噪声条件下的可靠性提供了系统性的解决方案。

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Method: 系统性地重新表述和扰动一组知名CSPLib问题，保持结构不变但修改上下文并引入误导元素，比较三个代表性LLM在原始和修改描述下的模型生成表现。

Result: LLMs能生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，显示出浅层理解和对措辞的敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动生成优化模型方面的成功可能更多源于数据污染而非真正的推理能力，其理解深度有限且对语言变化敏感。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Motivation: 当前LLM的对齐决策往往忽视人类社会的多样性，本研究旨在探索如何通过纳入多元价值观来影响LLM行为，以平衡安全性和公平代表性。

Method: 收集来自美国和德国参与者的对齐数据（N=1,095，27,375个评分），在毒性、情感意识、敏感性、刻板偏见和帮助性五个维度上评估LLM响应。使用不同社会群体的偏好微调多个大型语言模型和大型推理模型，同时改变评分尺度、分歧处理方法和优化技术。

Result: 发现系统性人口统计效应：男性参与者对响应的毒性评分比女性低18%；保守派和黑人参与者对情感意识的评分分别比自由派和白人参与者高27.9%和44%。技术设计选择显示强烈影响：保留评分者分歧比多数投票实现约53%更大的毒性减少；5点量表比二元格式产生约22%更多的减少；DPO在多值优化中始终优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 这些发现为回答一个关键问题提供了初步步骤：对齐应如何平衡专家驱动和用户驱动的信号，以确保安全性和公平代表性？

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

### [149] [Blurred Encoding for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13741)
*Silin Zhou,Yao Chen,Shuo Shang,Lisi Chen,Bingsheng He,Ryosuke Shibasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLUE是一种轨迹表示学习方法，通过逐步降低GPS坐标精度创建多级层次化补丁，在保持细粒度时空细节的同时捕获整体旅行模式，在多个下游任务中平均优于最佳基线30.90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA轨迹表示学习方法将原始GPS轨迹转换为网格或道路轨迹以捕获高层旅行语义，但会丢失细粒度时空细节，因为多个GPS点被分组到单个网格单元或道路段中。

Method: 提出BLUrred Encoding方法，逐步降低GPS坐标精度创建多级层次化补丁；采用编码器-解码器金字塔结构，每个补丁级别使用Transformer学习轨迹嵌入，池化为更高层级准备输入，上采样为更低层级提供指导；使用轨迹重建任务和MSE损失进行训练。

Result: 与8个SOTA TRL方法在3个下游任务上比较，BLUE始终比所有基线获得更高准确率，平均优于最佳基线30.90%。

Conclusion: BLUE通过多级层次化补丁有效平衡了细粒度时空细节和高层旅行语义的捕获，在轨迹表示学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

TL;DR: SCALEX是一个用于扩散模型潜在空间可扩展自动化探索的框架，通过自然语言提示从H空间提取语义方向，实现零样本解释，无需重新训练或标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分析扩散模型偏见的方法要么局限于预定义类别，要么依赖潜在方向的手动解释，限制了可扩展性并阻碍了发现微妙或意外模式。

Method: SCALEX从H空间提取语义上有意义的方向，仅使用自然语言提示，实现零样本解释，无需重新训练或标注。

Result: SCALEX能够检测职业提示中的性别偏见，对身份描述符的语义对齐进行排序，并在无监督情况下揭示聚类概念结构。

Conclusion: 通过直接将提示与潜在方向关联，SCALEX使扩散模型中的偏见分析比先前方法更具可扩展性、可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

*Feilong Wang,Fuqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对基于大语言模型的车辆轨迹预测模型进行了系统性漏洞分析，提出了一种单特征差分进化攻击方法，发现在黑盒设置下即使对周围车辆的单个运动学特征进行微小扰动也能显著破坏模型输出，揭示了LLM预测器在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管微调后的LLM能够准确预测车辆轨迹和换道意图，但这类LLM预测模型在安全关键驾驶系统中的鲁棒性尚未被探索，而LLM的可信度问题日益受到关注。

Method: 提出了一种单特征差分进化攻击方法，在黑盒设置下扰动LLM输入提示中周围车辆的单个运动学特征，并在highD数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使是微小且物理上合理的扰动也能显著破坏模型输出，揭示了LLM预测器对对抗性操纵的敏感性。进一步分析揭示了准确性和鲁棒性之间的权衡关系，并探讨了潜在的缓解方案。

Conclusion: 研究首次揭示了LLM驱动的自动驾驶模型在车辆交互场景中的对抗性漏洞，强调了未来基于LLM的智能交通系统需要面向鲁棒性进行设计。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出RedReg方法解决多模态学习中模态偏差导致的优化不平衡问题，通过自适应冗余调节机制平衡多模态信息优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，优势模态往往主导反向传播导致优化不平衡，现有方法存在两个问题：优势模态长期主导削弱表示-输出耦合导致冗余信息积累；直接统一调整优势模态梯度忽略模态间语义和方向性。

Method: 提出自适应冗余调节方法RedReg：构建冗余阶段监测器，基于有效增益增长率和冗余联合标准触发干预；设计共信息门控机制估计优势模态贡献；将优势模态梯度投影到联合多模态梯度子空间正交补空间，根据冗余度抑制梯度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在大多数场景下优于当前主流方法，消融实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RedReg方法通过自适应冗余调节机制有效解决了多模态学习中的优化不平衡问题，在保持模态特定信息的同时平衡了多模态优化。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

Conclusion: 所提出的自训练框架能有效解决低资源场景下的冒犯内容检测问题，通过利用未标记数据和协作伪标注实现了良好的性能。

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

TL;DR: MoETTA是一个基于熵的测试时自适应框架，通过集成混合专家架构来处理现实世界中的混合分布偏移问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中经常遇到混合分布偏移，现有TTA方法依赖统一的适应路径，无法处理不同域间可能冲突的梯度方向，且现有基准测试只关注合成或同质偏移。

Method: 提出MoETTA框架，集成混合专家架构，引入结构解耦的专家集合，使模型能够沿着不同的梯度方向进行适应，实现灵活和分离的参数更新。

Conclusion: 通过专家级多样性建模多个适应方向具有显著优势，MoETTA能够更好地适应异构偏移，在现实部署条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

TL;DR: PROF是一个利用大语言模型从自然语言描述和单个专家轨迹生成可执行奖励函数代码的离线模仿学习框架，通过奖励偏好排名策略自动选择和优化奖励函数，在D4RL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线模仿学习方法通常假设轨迹与专家演示的相似度与奖励正相关，这过度简化了奖励结构。需要更准确的方法来估计未标记数据集中的奖励。

Method: 提出PROF框架：1）利用LLM从自然语言描述和单个专家轨迹生成可执行奖励函数代码；2）提出奖励偏好排名(RPR)策略，无需环境交互或RL训练即可评估奖励函数质量；3）通过RPR和基于文本的梯度优化交替进行，自动选择和优化最优奖励函数。

Conclusion: PROF框架通过利用LLM和创新的奖励函数质量评估策略，实现了离线模仿学习中奖励函数的自动生成和优化，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法使用固定温度参数，这并不理想。此外，教师和学生模型之间的架构差异导致logit幅度不匹配。研究表明，学生在训练早期需要更软的概率，而在后期需要更尖锐的概率。

Conclusion: DTS方法通过动态调整温度参数，有效解决了知识蒸馏中固定温度方法的局限性，在不同任务和数据集上都取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

Conclusion: Transformer架构的特定代数形式遵循这些投影原理，而非任意设计选择，为理解自注意力提供了数学基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

*Emanuel Covaci,Fabian Galis,Radu Balan,Daniela Zaharie,Darian Onchis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的可微分全局可解释性方法，通过在模型训练中直接集成特征重要性估计，使用ScoresActivation函数实现特征排序，从而在保持高预测性能的同时提供忠实、稳定的特征重要性排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的事后解释方法与模型训练过程脱节，限制了其忠实性和实用性。需要一种将特征重要性估计直接集成到模型训练中的方法，以弥合模型准确性和可解释性之间的差距。

Method: 提出ScoresActivation函数作为特征排序机制嵌入学习流程，使模型能够以可微分和端到端可训练的方式根据特征对预测性能的贡献进行优先级排序。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法产生了与SHAP值和真实特征重要性一致的全局忠实、稳定的特征排名，同时保持高预测性能。特征评分速度比传统SHAP方法快150倍，仅需2秒训练时间，而SHAP需要300秒。使用10个特征（5个相关）时分类准确率提高11.24%，使用16个特征（5个相关，11个不相关）时提高29.33%。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了模型准确性和可解释性之间的差距，为固有可解释的机器学习提供了一个可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

TL;DR: DAS是一个分布感知的推测解码框架，通过利用历史rollout数据中的模式来加速强化学习后训练中的rollout阶段，减少50%的rollout时间而不改变模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习后训练的效率受到rollout阶段的限制，特别是长尾分布的生成长度问题，少数长生成占据了大部分时间成本。同时，历史rollout数据揭示了稳定的提示级别模式。

Method: DAS整合了两个关键思想：基于最近rollout构建的自适应非参数草稿器（使用增量维护的后缀树），以及长度感知的推测策略，为支配时间的轨迹分配更激进的草稿预算。

Result: 在数学和代码推理任务上的实验表明，DAS将rollout时间减少了50%，同时保持了相同的训练曲线。

Conclusion: 分布感知的推测解码能够在不影响学习质量的情况下显著加速RL后训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

Conclusion: AnaCP成功解决了类增量学习中的特征适应问题，在保持效率的同时实现了接近理论上限的性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了随机森林中bootstrap rate(BR)对回归性能的影响，发现调整BR可以显著提升模型性能，并揭示了数据集特征与最佳BR之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林通常使用BR=1.0的默认设置，但缺乏对BR参数影响的系统研究。本文旨在探索不同BR值对RF回归性能的影响及其与数据集特征的关系。

Method: 在39个异构回归数据集和16种RF配置上，系统性地将BR从0.2变化到5.0，使用重复二折交叉验证和均方误差进行评估，并在合成数据集上验证噪声水平与BR的关系。

Result: 结果显示：24个数据集的最佳BR≤1.0，15个数据集的最佳BR>1.0，仅4个数据集BR=1.0为最优。具有强全局特征-目标关系的数据集偏好更高BR，而局部目标方差较高的数据集偏好更低BR。

Conclusion: BR是一个重要的超参数，应根据数据集特征进行调整以优化RF回归模型。在低噪声场景中高BR可减少模型偏差，在高噪声场景中低BR可减少模型方差。

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在SQL查询的抽象语法树节点级别估计不确定性的框架，用于检测LLM生成的SQL错误，通过语义感知标签算法和模式感知特征训练分类器来预测节点错误概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于token对数概率的聚合序列级置信度测量方法在检测LLM生成的SQL错误方面效果有限，需要更细粒度和语义基础的不确定性估计方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）语义感知标签算法为AST节点分配正确性标签；2）使用模式感知和词汇特征训练监督分类器预测节点错误概率。

Result: 在多个数据库和数据集上，该方法显著优于token对数概率方法，平均AUC提高了27.44%，并在跨数据库评估中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 节点中心、语义基础的不确定性估计是聚合序列级置信度测量的强大且可解释的替代方案，支持针对性修复、人机协同审查和下游选择性执行。

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为径向补偿（RC）的信息几何方法，用于解决流形上生成模型中曲率与模型参数纠缠的问题。RC通过选择切空间中的基础密度，使似然仅依赖于从极点的测地距离，从而将参数语义与曲率解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如指数映射和保体积图在流形生成模型中存在问题：指数映射具有刚性、半径相关的雅可比矩阵，而保体积图虽然保持密度但扭曲测地距离。这两种方法都将曲率与模型参数纠缠在一起，增加了梯度方差。

Method: 引入径向补偿（RC）方法，选择切空间中的基础密度，使似然仅依赖于测地距离。扩展RC到已知测地极体积的流形，并推导平衡指数（bExp）图族，平衡体积扭曲和测地误差。

Result: RC在多种生成模型中表现稳定，包括密度估计、VAE、图像和图的流模型以及蛋白质模型。RC提高了似然度，恢复了清晰的测地半径，并防止了高维流中的半径爆炸。

Conclusion: RC-bExp成为流形上似然训练生成模型的稳健默认选择，能够解耦参数语义与曲率，减少梯度方差和流成本。

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

Motivation: 现有药物推荐方法存在两个根本局限：将医学实体视为独立特征而未建模其对药物选择的协同效应；使用静态因果关系无法适应患者特定情境和健康状态。

Method: 提出CafeMed框架，包含两个关键组件：因果权重生成器（CWG）将静态因果效应转换为基于患者状态的动态调制权重；通道协调注意力细化模块（CHARM）捕捉诊断和程序之间的复杂相互依赖关系。

Conclusion: 整合动态因果关系和跨模态协同效应能够产生更符合临床实践和个性化的药物推荐，CafeMed框架在准确性和安全性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

Motivation: CFG方法在训练时随机切换条件和空提示，但在采样时同时输出空提示和条件提示，导致训练和采样过程中的噪声估计不一致。这种不一致性影响了生成质量和提示对齐度。

Method: 提出CFG-EC校正方案，通过重新对齐无条件噪声误差分量使其与条件误差分量正交，防止两个引导分量之间的干扰，从而约束采样误差的上界并建立更可靠的引导轨迹。

Result: 数值实验表明，CFG-EC比CFG和CFG++更有效地处理无条件分量，在低引导采样机制下性能显著提升，并在所有情况下都实现了更高的提示对齐度。

Conclusion: CFG-EC是一种可增强任何基于CFG方法的通用校正方案，能够通过改进无条件噪声预测来提高图像生成的保真度和提示对齐质量。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

Result: 在Criteo和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验证明该方法能有效审计标签隐私保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模生产环境中的实用隐私审计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: 该论文主张在主观性机器学习任务中，应将标注分布视为真实标签而非聚合为单一标签，通过软标签训练保留认知不确定性，在视觉和NLP任务中显著改善模型与人类标注的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准做法将多样的人类标注聚合为单一标签，这在模糊数据上存在认知偏差，迫使模型对本质上模糊的案例表达虚假信心，造成模型确定性与人类感知多样性之间的不匹配。

Method: 采用软标签训练方法，将标注分布本身视为真实标签进行训练，而不是将多样的人类判断聚合为点估计。

Result: 在视觉和NLP任务中，软标签训练相比硬标签训练实现了32%更低的KL散度和61%更强的模型与标注熵相关性，同时保持了相同的准确率。

Conclusion: 标注分布不应被视为需要聚合的噪声信号，而应作为认知不确定性的忠实表示，模型应该学习重现这种不确定性。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Fair-GNE方法，在医疗工作者多智能体系统中通过广义纳什均衡框架实现公平的工作负载分配，相比传统方法显著提升了公平性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法通过事后协调来塑造奖励以实现公平，但缺乏在运行时由个体智能体不可改变的可证明自执行公平性。在共享资源的医疗工作者设置中，需要确保公平的工作负载分配。

Method: 将多智能体强化学习建模为约束广义纳什均衡寻求游戏，在问题自然结构中规定理想的公平集体均衡，使任何智能体都无法通过单方面改变决策来改善其效用函数。

Result: 在定制的高保真复苏模拟器中，Fair-GNE相比固定惩罚基线显著改善了工作负载平衡（0.89 vs. 0.33 JFI，p < 0.01），同时保持86%的任务成功率。

Conclusion: Fair-GNE通过自适应约束执行在多智能体医疗系统中实现了统计显著的公平性提升，为大规模学习型医疗系统提供了清晰的原则性公平执行框架。

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种自动偏见识别框架，用于检测大型语言模型中的显性和隐性社会偏见，并通过微调和数据增强策略提升模型在偏见检测方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从训练数据中继承了显性和隐性偏见，这些偏见可能传播有害刻板印象和错误信息，因此识别和减轻LLM中的偏见对于确保公平输出至关重要。

Method: 采用双管齐下的方法检测文本数据中的显性和隐性偏见，使用StereoSet和CrowSPairs等偏见基准评估多种生成模型，并应用微调技术和数据增强来提升模型性能。

Result: 微调模型在性别偏见方面表现不佳，但在识别和避免种族偏见方面表现出色。增强策略使模型在跨数据集测试中表现出良好的适应性，在隐性偏见基准上的性能提升高达20%。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在偏见检测方面取得了一定成功，但它们往往过度依赖关键词。通过微调和数据增强可以显著提升模型在识别隐性偏见方面的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

TL;DR: 本文针对临床机器学习中的Rashomon效应（多个模型性能相近）问题，提出了干预效率（IE）和扰动验证框架（PVF）两种工具，用于在资源受限和噪声数据环境下进行更稳健的模型评估与选择。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床机器学习中，由于数据集小、不平衡、噪声多，加上高维弱识别特征，导致多个模型性能相近（Rashomon效应），传统验证方法不可靠，且未考虑资源约束和临床实用性。

Method: 提出干预效率（IE）作为容量感知指标，量化模型在有限干预资源下识别可行动真阳性的效率；提出扰动验证框架（PVF）评估模型在数据扰动下的稳定性。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上的实验表明，使用这些工具能够选择出更稳健泛化且符合容量约束的模型。

Conclusion: IE和PVF为解决临床环境中的Rashomon效应提供了新方向，将预测性能与临床效用联系起来，实现更可靠的模型部署。

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

Conclusion: 幻影注入技术有效解决了扩散模型在晶体生成中原子数量固定的限制，大幅提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

*Nicola Rares Franco,Lorenzo Tedesco*

TL;DR: CPFN是一种条件分布估计的生成框架，通过随机映射学习条件分布，支持高效条件采样和蒙特卡洛统计估计，无需可逆性或对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决条件分布估计问题，提供高效的采样和统计估计方法，避免传统方法对可逆性或对抗训练的需求。

Method: 学习随机映射φ(x,u)，使得φ(x,U)与Y|X=x的分布近似相同，通过基于Kullback-Leibler的目标函数进行训练。

Result: 实验表明CPFN性能与最先进方法相当或更优，包括核估计、树基算法和深度学习技术，同时保持轻量级和易训练特性。

Conclusion: CPFN提供了一个高效、轻量级的条件分布估计框架，在保持竞争力的同时简化了训练过程。

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

*Clément Dumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nnterp是一个轻量级包装器，为Transformer分析提供统一接口，同时保持原始HuggingFace实现的正确性，解决了现有工具在一致性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer可解释性研究工具面临根本性权衡：自定义实现（如TransformerLens）确保接口一致但需要手动适配每个架构，而直接使用HuggingFace（通过NNsight）保持精确行为但缺乏跨模型标准化。

Method: 开发nnterp作为NNsight的轻量级包装器，通过自动模块重命名和全面验证测试，为50+模型变体（涵盖16个架构家族）提供统一分析接口，包含常见可解释性方法的实现。

Result: nnterp使研究人员能够编写一次干预代码并在多个模型变体上部署，提供对注意力概率的直接访问，并通过验证测试确保与自定义模型的兼容性。

Conclusion: nnterp在机制可解释性工具中弥合了正确性和可用性之间的差距。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

Classical concepts such as covariance, regression, and information measures are revisited through the lens of Hilbert space geometry. We also introduce kernel density estimation, kernel embeddings of distributions, and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The exposition is designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced topics, including Gaussian processes, kernel Bayesian inference, and functional analytic approaches to modern machine learning.

Conclusion: PAFM通过扰动感知的流匹配方法，有效提升了时间序列生成的结构一致性和对扰动的敏感性。

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: CLO是一个通过算法-系统协同设计实现的轻量级CPU KVCache卸载系统，解决了现有系统在CPU瓶颈、PCIe带宽利用和GPU同步方面的三个关键问题，显著提升了LLM推理的解码吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着百万token LLM的发展，推理系统的可扩展性面临KVCache内存占用和数据传输开销的挑战。现有卸载系统虽然将KVCache迁移到CPU内存并使用top-k注意力减少数据传输，但忽视了CPU瓶颈问题。

Method: CLO采用算法-系统协同设计，包括：粗粒度的头级近似GPU缓存策略、数据预取与GPU持久缓存的无缝结合、零拷贝传输引擎以充分利用PCIe带宽，以及GPU中心的同步方法消除GPU停顿。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的LLM上的评估表明，CLO在保持与最先进系统相当精度的同时，显著减少了CPU开销，充分利用了PCIe带宽，将解码吞吐量提高了9.3%-66.6%。

Conclusion: 算法-系统协同设计对于现代GPU平台上内存受限的LLM推理至关重要。CLO已开源在GitHub上。

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合确定性扩散框架，用于处理包含数值、分类和离散属性的异构表格数据缺失值填补问题，通过分离特征到两个互补的生成通道来解决现有扩散模型在混合类型数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据中经常存在不完整数据，且数值、分类和离散属性共存于同一数据集。现有基于扩散的填补模型假设同质特征空间并依赖随机去噪轨迹，难以保持条件一致性，导致分类变量信息崩溃或数值变量确定性更新的不稳定性。

Method: 提出混合确定性扩散框架，将异构特征分离到两个互补生成通道：连续DDIM通道为数值变量提供高效稳定的确定性去噪，离散潜在路径扩散通道基于loopholing离散扩散建模分类和离散特征而不离开有效样本流形。两个通道在统一条件填补目标下训练。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，与现有基于扩散的方法和经典方法相比，该框架在MCAR、MAR和MNAR设置下实现了更高的填补精度、更稳定的采样轨迹和更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结果表明结构感知扩散过程对于推进深度学习处理不完整表格数据方法的重要性，证明了单一扩散过程不足以处理混合类型表格填补问题。

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Result: 提出了一种新的维度降维投影质量评估方法，能够更好地识别视觉扭曲问题。

Conclusion: 扭曲指数(WI)为维度降维投影的质量评估提供了新的视角，特别关注视觉表示的准确性，有助于避免误导性结论。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

Conclusion: 互补学习机制的协同整合能够实现稳健的零样本泛化，接近先前工作中的少样本基线性能。

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

Motivation: 科学创意生成和选择需要遵循目标概率分布的探索，而当前AI基准测试有客观正确答案，通过强化学习训练LLMs会抑制概率探索。

Method: 进行系统实验，要求LLMs按照简单概率分布生成输出，测试模型是否能遵循分布。

Result: 所有测试的现代LLMs都严重无法遵循分布，即使要求以49%概率输出"1"，模型仍几乎100%输出"0"，这种阶跃函数行为甚至压倒了模型内置的强烈偏见。

Conclusion: 现代LLMs在概率探索方面存在严重缺陷，无法按照指定概率分布生成输出，这对科学创意生成等需要概率探索的应用构成了挑战。

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

Conclusion: Adapformer通过有效的通道管理成功结合了通道独立和通道依赖方法的优点，在多变量时间序列预测任务中实现了卓越的性能，成为该领域的先进解决方案。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

Abstract: Dense retrieval, as the core component of e-commerce search engines, maps user queries and items into a unified semantic space through pre-trained embedding models to enable large-scale real-time semantic retrieval. Despite the rapid advancement of LLMs gradually replacing traditional BERT architectures for embedding, their training paradigms still adhere to BERT-like supervised fine-tuning and hard negative mining strategies. This approach relies on complex offline hard negative sample construction pipelines, which constrain model iteration efficiency and hinder the evolutionary potential of semantic representation capabilities. Besides, existing multi-task learning frameworks face the seesaw effect when simultaneously optimizing semantic relevance and non-relevance objectives. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-GRPO, a multi-objective reinforcement learning-based dense retrieval framework designed to address these challenges. The method eliminates offline hard negative sample construction by dynamically retrieving Top-K candidate products for each query during training, while introducing a relevance LLM as a reward model to generate real-time feedback. Specifically, the retrieval model dynamically optimizes embedding representations through reinforcement learning, with reward signals combining LLM-generated relevance scores, product quality scores, and multi-way exclusivity metrics to achieve multi-objective user preference alignment and real-time error correction. This mechanism not only removes dependency on hard negatives but also mitigates the seesaw effect through collaborative multi-objective optimization, significantly enhancing the model's semantic generalization capability for complex long-tail queries. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of Retrieval-GRPO, which has been deployed on China's largest e-commerce platform.

Conclusion: NeuroPath在多跳问答任务中表现出色，具有良好的鲁棒性和可扩展性，为复杂知识推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

Conclusion: LGSID框架成功解决了本地生活推荐中的空间感知问题，通过地理对齐和分层标记显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在训练阶段使用生成范式进行表示学习，但在推理阶段仍回归标准判别范式，未能充分利用生成能力提升预测精度。

Method: 提出对称掩码生成范式SGCTR，在训练阶段学习特征依赖关系获得生成能力，在推理阶段应用生成能力迭代重定义输入样本特征。

Result: 大量实验验证SGCTR的优越性，证明在训练和推理阶段对称应用生成范式能显著提升CTR预测性能。

Conclusion: 在CTR预测中对称应用生成范式能充分发挥其潜力，SGCTR框架通过训练和推理阶段的对称性有效提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly being explored in click-through rate (CTR) prediction field to overcome the limitations of the conventional discriminative paradigm, which rely on a simple binary classification objective. However, existing generative models typically confine the generative paradigm to the training phase, primarily for representation learning. During online inference, they revert to a standard discriminative paradigm, failing to leverage their powerful generative capabilities to further improve prediction accuracy. This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases. Specifically, after acquiring generative capabilities by learning feature dependencies during training, SGCTR applies the generative capabilities during online inference to iteratively redefine the features of input samples, which mitigates the impact of noisy features and enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGCTR, demonstrating that applying the generative paradigm symmetrically across both training and inference significantly unlocks its power in CTR prediction.

Conclusion: 通过知识蒸馏与动态令牌压缩的结合，成功开发出高效的双语压缩模型，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: This technical report presents the training methodology and evaluation results of the open-source Jasper-Token-Compression-600M model, released in November 2025. Building on previous distillation-based recipes from the English Stella and Jasper models, we successfully extend this approach to a bilingual (English and Chinese) domain, further enhancing model performance through the incorporation of contrastive learning. A key innovation of our model is the introduction of a one-dimensional convolution-based token compression module. We dynamically adjust the compression rate during training, enabling the model to learn more robust and efficient compressed text representations. By combining knowledge distillation with token compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in both embedding quality and inference efficiency. Our model performs with higher efficiency than a traditional 0.6B model while achieving performance comparable to that of an 8B model.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现可以设计具有强亮度对比度的色彩映射，既能支持空间视觉又能传达清晰的情感内涵，情感内涵不仅取决于色彩尺度，还取决于数据分布频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感可视化设计中，通过颜色亮度传达情感（浅色积极、深色消极）的方法不适用于使用颜色表示空间数据模式的视觉化，因为这类可视化需要亮度对比来显示空间结构细节。

Method: 研究设计具有强亮度对比度的色彩映射，同时考察色彩尺度和数据频率对情感内涵的影响。

Result: 成功设计出既能支持空间视觉又能传达清晰情感内涵的色彩映射，发现情感内涵具有数据依赖性。

Conclusion: 强调数据感知设计的重要性，需要考虑编码数据的视觉特征以及这些特征在特定数据属性下的具体表现。

Abstract: Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.

Conclusion: 这种区分方法是确保AI系统对人类、社会和环境福祉可靠性的重要前提，是构建健全AI系统的坚实基础。

Abstract: As a capability coming from computation, how does AI differ fundamentally from the capabilities delivered by rule-based software program? The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.

Motivation: 研究洁癖症（对细菌的恐惧）这一普遍焦虑障碍，探索游戏化虚拟现实干预在模拟污染相关场景和评估其情绪心理影响方面的潜力。

Method: 开发基于VR的喷嚏模拟游戏，7名参与者完成基线版本和实验版本（含喷嚏模拟），使用PANAS和STAI-S问卷测量情绪反应。

Result: 喷嚏模拟导致负面情绪和焦虑水平轻微增加，积极情绪减少，但这些差异在统计学上不显著（p > 0.05）。

Conclusion: 这项探索性研究凸显了基于VR的干预在理解和解决污染相关焦虑方面的潜力，为未来更大规模、更多样化的参与者研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Mysophobia, or the fear of germs, is a prevalent anxiety disorder that significantly impacts daily life. This study investigates the potential of a gamified virtual reality (VR) intervention to simulate contamination-related scenarios and assess their emotional and psychological effects. A VR game based sneeze simulation was developed to evaluate its influence on participants' emotional states. Seven participants completed two versions of the game: a baseline version and an experimental version featuring the sneeze simulation. Emotional responses were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State (STAI-S) questionnaires. The results revealed slight increases in negative affect and anxiety levels during the sneeze simulation. Also, a reduction in positive affect was revealed. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This is likely due to small sample sizes, a lack of grossness in the simulation, or participants not being clinically mysophobes. This exploratory study highlights the potential of VR-based interventions for understanding and addressing contamination-related anxieties. It provides a foundation for future research with larger and more diverse participant pools.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了智能用户界面(IUIs)的设计，以解决临终患者的深刻存在性孤独问题。通过定性访谈建立了需求模型，提出了"三大支柱、十二原则"框架，主张技术应追求超越而非模拟人类连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人机交互在"死亡技术"领域主要关注数字遗产管理等实际问题，忽视了临终患者的主观存在性需求，特别是那些在孤独中面对死亡的人群。

Method: 对14名孤独的临终患者进行了深入的定性访谈，建立了基于实证的需求模型。

Result: 提出了"三大支柱、十二原则"框架，用于设计作为"存在伴侣"的IUIs。用户评估表明，在此情境下技术应追求超越而非模拟。

Conclusion: IUIs应创造增强或超越人类能力的体验，而非试图模拟基本的人类连接，这反而可能加深孤独感。技术应作为"充分活到最后的伙伴"而非"死亡工具"。

Abstract: This study explores the design of Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) to address the profound existential loneliness of terminally ill individuals. While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has made inroads in "Thanatechnology," current research often focuses on practical aspects like digital legacy management, overlooking the subjective, existential needs of those facing death in isolation. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The "Three Pillars, Twelve Principles" framework for designing IUIs as "Existential Companions"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness. This research provides a clear, user-centered path for designing technology that serves not as a "tool for dying," but as a "partner for living fully until the end".

Method: 采用概念整合方法，综合人力资源管理、人机交互和科学技术研究领域的见解，而非定性或实证研究。

Result: 分析表明算法系统能提高运营效率，但存在强化偏见、忽视工作关系性和情境性维度的风险，特别是在创造力、同理心和协作问题解决等无形贡献方面存在数据驱动绩效测量的空白。

Conclusion: 提出基于社会技术视角的算法问责制，强调程序透明度、组织公正和员工自主权，为未来工作和管理技术设计提供理论贡献，支持而非限制人类自主权和组织生活。

Abstract: This study examines the evolving impact of algorithmic management on human resource management (HRM) practices, with a focus on employee autonomy, procedural transparency, and the sociotechnical dynamics of performance evaluation. Rather than adopting a qualitative or empirical approach, the paper develops a conceptual integration of insights from HRM, human-computer interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies. The analysis highlights that although algorithmic systems can enhance operational efficiency, they risk reinforcing biases and narrowing the relational and contextual dimensions of work. These systems often overlook intangible contributions such as creativity, empathy, and collaborative problem solving, revealing gaps in data-driven performance measurement. In response, the study proposes a sociotechnical perspective on algorithmic accountability that emphasizes procedural transparency, organizational justice, and employee agency. By revisiting foundational questions within the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic management, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the future of work and the design of managerial technologies that support, rather than constrain, human autonomy and organizational life.

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risky situations has always been a challenge in driving. Existing risk-detection methods excel at identifying collisions but face challenges in assessing the behavior of road users in non-collision situations. This paper introduces Visionary Co-Driver, a system that leverages large language models to identify non-collision roadside risks and alert drivers based on their eye movements. Specifically, the system combines video processing algorithms and LLMs to identify potentially risky road users. These risks are dynamically indicated on an adaptive heads-up display interface to enhance drivers' attention. A user study with 41 drivers confirms that Visionary Co-Driver improves drivers' risk perception and supports their recognition of roadside risks.

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) are gradually becoming part of our daily lives. However, effective communication between road users and AVs remains a significant challenge. Although various external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been developed to facilitate interactions, psychological factors, such as a lack of trust and inadequate emotional signaling, may still deter users from confidently engaging with AVs in certain contexts. To address this gap, we propose TailCue, an exploration of how tail-based eHMIs affect user interaction with AVs. We first investigated mappings between tail movements and emotional expressions from robotics and zoology, and accordingly developed a motion-emotion mapping scheme. A physical robotic tail was implemented, and specific tail motions were designed based on our scheme. An online, video-based user study with 21 participants was conducted. Our findings suggest that, although the intended emotions conveyed by the tail were not consistently recognized, open-ended feedback indicated that the tail motion needs to align with the scenarios and cues. Our result highlights the necessity of scenario-specific optimization to enhance tail-based eHMIs. Future work will refine tail movement strategies to maximize their effectiveness across diverse interaction contexts.

Abstract: Usability is a key factor in the effectiveness of recommender systems. However, the analysis of user interfaces is a time-consuming process that requires expertise. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to automate such evaluations. In this work, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs to assess the usability of recommender system interfaces by considering a variety of publicly available systems as examples. We take user interface screenshots from multiple of these recommender platforms to cover both preference elicitation and recommendation presentation scenarios. An LLM is instructed to analyze these interfaces with regard to different usability criteria and provide explanatory feedback. Our evaluation demonstrates how LLMs can support heuristic-style usability assessments at scale to support the improvement of user experience.

Abstract: Emotion education is a crucial lesson for children aged 3 to 6. However, existing technologies primarily focus on promoting emotion education from the child's perspective, often neglecting the central role of parents in guiding early childhood emotion development. In this work, we conducted co-design sessions with five experienced kindergarten teachers and five parents to identify parental challenges and the roles that AI can play in family emotion education. Guided by these insights, we developed PACEE, an assistant for supporting parent-AI collaborative emotion education. PACEE enables parents to engage in emotional dialogues about common scenarios, with multiple forms of support provided by generative AI. It combines insights from parents and AI to model children's emotional states and collaboratively delivers personalized, parent-mediated guidance. In a user study involving 16 families, we found that PACEE significantly enhances parent-child engagement, encourages more in-depth emotional communication, and improves the parental experience. Our findings advance emotion coaching theory in both family settings and LLM-assisted contexts, offering valuable insights for designing AI-supported, parent-centered family education systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究了AI偏见（类别不平衡）与人类偏见（基础比率忽视）在决策支持系统中的相互作用，发现两者会相互强化形成复合偏见，影响人们对AI的依赖校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人类与AI在决策中互动增多，虽然AI和人类偏见各自已被广泛研究，但两者之间的复杂交互作用尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究类别不平衡这种AI偏见如何影响人们对AI决策支持系统的依赖，以及它如何与基础比率忽视这种人类偏见相互作用。

Method: 在在线研究中，46名参与者使用基于AI的决策支持系统对三种疾病进行分类，该系统分别在平衡或不平衡数据集上训练。采用被试内设计，考察类别不平衡对参与者AI依赖校准的影响。

Result: 研究发现类别不平衡破坏了参与者对AI依赖的校准。更重要的是，观察到类别不平衡与基础比率忽视之间存在相互强化效应，为人类-AI复合偏见提供了证据。

Conclusion: 基于这些发现，作者主张采用交互主义视角，并呼吁进一步研究人类-AI互动中偏见的相互强化效应。

Abstract: Humans increasingly interact with artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making. However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 本文提出为盲人和低视力开发者设计减少认知负荷的代码呈现方法，基于心理学原理识别影响编程性能和学习的认知负荷因素，并评估现有解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力个体无法依赖基于视觉的认知负荷管理方法，而现有解决方案很少系统考虑认知负荷问题，需要专门设计来改善他们的编程体验。

Method: 基于心理学科学基础识别影响编程性能和学习的认知负荷方面，评估现有BLV用户编程子任务解决方案，提出初步的代码呈现设计建议。

Result: 确定了影响编程的认知负荷关键因素，分析了现有解决方案的不足，提出了能够减少BLV开发者认知负荷的代码呈现设计建议。

Conclusion: 通过遵循提出的代码呈现设计建议，可以有效降低盲人和低视力开发者的认知负荷，从而改善他们的编程任务表现和学习效果。

Abstract: Evidence supports that reducing cognitive load (CL) improves task performance for people of all abilities. This effect is specifically important for blind-and-low-vision (BLV) individuals because they cannot rely on many common methods of managing CL, which are frequently vision-based techniques. Current accessible "solutions" for BLV developers only sporadically consider CL in their design. There isn't a way to know whether CL is being alleviated by them. Neither do we know if alleviating CL is part of the mechanism behind why these solutions help BLV people. Using a strong foundation in psychological sciences, we identify aspects of CL that impact performance and learning in programming. These aspects are then examined when evaluating existing solutions for programming sub-tasks for BLV users. We propose an initial design "recommendations" for presentation of code which, when followed, will reduce cognitive load for BLV developers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统级的多智能体路径规划框架，将规划与执行集成，通过有限时域闭环分解算法实现实时响应和大规模智能体扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAPF方法将规划与执行分离，以临时方式处理问题变体，缺乏统一框架来建模不确定性。

Method: 引入MAPF系统作为核心形式模型，将MAPF视为控制设计问题，并提出有限时域闭环分解算法，利用组合结构实现高效闭环操作。

Result: 算法实现毫秒级执行启动，扩展到数千个智能体，计算时间比开环基线减少两个数量级，在随机延迟和智能体到达情况下显著提高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 通过系统级建模、分解和闭环设计，为MAPF的分析和推进建立了原则性基础。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种激光雷达-惯性里程计系统LIO-MARS，通过结合激光雷达和IMU数据，使用连续时间B样条轨迹和多分辨率面元地图对齐，实现了高精度的实时定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主机器人系统需要鲁棒的实时感知能力进行安全导航，特别是在搜救等应用中。激光雷达提供精确距离测量，IMU约束加速度和旋转，两者互补可提高定位精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用连续时间B样条轨迹，通过高斯混合模型对齐多分辨率面元地图。采用非均匀时间节点放置的扫描窗口确保轨迹连续性，使用克罗内克和与积加速协方差和GMM计算。无迹变换去偏斜面元，分割为帧内段便于运动补偿。

Conclusion: LIO-MARS系统在精度和鲁棒性方面达到了先进水平，通过激光雷达和IMU的互补约束以及优化的计算策略，为自主机器人导航提供了可靠的定位解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems heavily rely on environment knowledge to safely navigate. For search & rescue, a flying robot requires robust real-time perception, enabled by complementary sensors. IMU data constrains acceleration and rotation, whereas LiDAR measures accurate distances around the robot. Building upon the LiDAR odometry MARS, our LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) jointly aligns multi-resolution surfel maps with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using a continuous-time B-spline trajectory. Our new scan window uses non-uniform temporal knot placement to ensure continuity over the whole trajectory without additional scan delay. Moreover, we accelerate essential covariance and GMM computations with Kronecker sums and products by a factor of 3.3. An unscented transform de-skews surfels, while a splitting into intra-scan segments facilitates motion compensation during spline optimization. Complementary soft constraints on relative poses and preintegrated IMU pseudo-measurements further improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive evaluation showcases the state-of-the-art quality of our LIO-MARS w.r.t. recent LIO systems on various handheld, ground and aerial vehicle-based datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: STAR是一个统一时空主动检索框架，将记忆查询和具身动作整合在单一决策循环中，用于动态开放世界中的物体检索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能解决部分问题：场景图捕获空间关系但忽略时间定位，时序推理方法建模动态但不支持具身交互，动态场景图处理两者但仍是封闭世界且词汇固定。需要统一框架来处理包含属性、空间上下文和过去状态的物体检索请求。

Method: STAR框架利用非参数长期记忆和工作记忆支持高效回忆，使用视觉语言模型在每一步选择时间或空间动作，将记忆查询和具身动作统一在单一决策循环中。

Result: 在STARBench基准测试和Tiago机器人上的实验表明，STAR始终优于场景图和纯记忆基线，证明了将时间搜索和空间搜索作为统一问题处理的好处。

Conclusion: STAR框架成功地将时空搜索统一起来，在动态开放世界环境中实现了更有效的物体检索，为服务机器人在复杂环境中的操作提供了新方法。

Abstract: Service robots must retrieve objects in dynamic, open-world settings where requests may reference attributes ("the red mug"), spatial context ("the mug on the table"), or past states ("the mug that was here yesterday"). Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BIM差异驱动的主动感知框架，用于无人机和无人地面车辆在动态建筑环境中的协同导航，通过融合实时LiDAR数据和BIM先验来维护动态2D占据地图，实现风险触发的重新扫描以降低不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航方法依赖静态BIM先验或有限的机载感知能力，无法有效应对动态建筑环境中的不确定性，需要一种能够主动感知并降低导航风险的框架。

Method: 融合空中和地面机器人的实时LiDAR数据与BIM先验，维护动态2D占据地图；通过统一的走廊风险度量（包含占据不确定性、BIM地图差异和间隙）评估导航安全；当风险超过阈值时，无人机自主重新扫描受影响区域。

Result: 在PX4-Gazebo仿真中验证，风险触发重新扫描相比静态BIM导航将平均走廊风险降低58%，地图熵降低43%，同时保持间隙边界大于0.4米；相比前沿探索方法，在任务时间减半的情况下实现相似的不确定性降低。

Conclusion: 将BIM先验与风险自适应空中感知相结合，能够为建筑机器人提供可扩展的、不确定性感知的自主性。

Abstract: This paper presents a BIM-discrepancy-driven active sensing framework for cooperative navigation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in dynamic construction environments. Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.

Conclusion: FlexiCup展示了多模态传感吸盘在非结构化环境中接触感知操作的可行性，硬件设计和固件已开源。

Abstract: Conventional suction cups lack sensing capabilities for contact-aware manipulation in unstructured environments. This paper presents FlexiCup, a fully wireless multimodal suction cup that integrates dual-zone vision-tactile sensing. The central zone dynamically switches between vision and tactile modalities via illumination control for contact detection, while the peripheral zone provides continuous spatial awareness for approach planning. FlexiCup supports both vacuum and Bernoulli suction modes through modular mechanical configurations, achieving complete wireless autonomy with onboard computation and power. We validate hardware versatility through dual control paradigms. Modular perception-driven grasping across structured surfaces with varying obstacle densities demonstrates comparable performance between vacuum (90.0% mean success) and Bernoulli (86.7% mean success) modes. Diffusion-based end-to-end learning achieves 73.3% success on inclined transport and 66.7% on orange extraction tasks. Ablation studies confirm that multi-head attention coordinating dual-zone observations provides 13% improvements for contact-aware manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型使用同步流匹配，依赖刚性的均匀时间调度，缺乏动作上下文感知和异步自校正能力，在长时程任务中容易因单个动作错误导致级联失败。

Method: 提出异步流匹配VLA框架，在非均匀时间调度中生成动作token，引入置信度评估器提取初始生成动作的置信度，选择性修正不准确的动作token，并提出了SFM和AFM的统一训练过程。

Conclusion: AsyncVLA通过异步生成在AFM中实现了状态最优性能，其异步生成机制显著提升了长时程任务的稳定性和成功率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.

Abstract: Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

Abstract: Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.

Abstract: Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Active SLAM) involves the strategic planning and precise control of a robotic system's movement in order to construct a highly accurate and comprehensive representation of its surrounding environment, which has garnered significant attention within the research community. While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms estimate drone poses and build a 3D map using a single camera. Current algorithms include sparse methods that lack detailed geometry, while learning-driven approaches produce dense maps but are computationally intensive. Monocular SLAM also faces scale ambiguities, which affect its accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Place recognition, the ability to identify previously visited locations, is critical for both biological navigation and autonomous systems. This review synthesizes findings from robotic systems, animal studies, and human research to explore how different systems encode and recall place. We examine the computational and representational strategies employed across artificial systems, animals, and humans, highlighting convergent solutions such as topological mapping, cue integration, and memory management. Animal systems reveal evolved mechanisms for multimodal navigation and environmental adaptation, while human studies provide unique insights into semantic place concepts, cultural influences, and introspective capabilities. Artificial systems showcase scalable architectures and data-driven models. We propose a unifying set of concepts by which to consider and develop place recognition mechanisms and identify key challenges such as generalization, robustness, and environmental variability. This review aims to foster innovations in artificial localization by connecting future developments in artificial place recognition systems to insights from both animal navigation research and human spatial cognition studies.

Abstract: In our work, we extend the current state-of-the-art approach for autonomous multi-UAV exploration to consumer-level UAVs, such as the DJI Mini 3 Pro. We propose a pipeline that selects viewpoint pairs from which the depth can be estimated and plans the trajectory that satisfies motion constraints necessary for odometry estimation. For the multi-UAV exploration, we propose a semi-distributed communication scheme that distributes the workload in a balanced manner. We evaluate our model performance in simulation for different numbers of UAVs and prove its ability to safely explore the environment and reconstruct the map even with the hardware limitations of consumer-grade UAVs.

Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Abstract: Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.

Abstract: We propose a method for combining Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) derived from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications with any given robot policy to turn an unsafe policy into a safe one with formal guarantees.  The two components are combined via HCLBF-derived safety certificates, thus producing commands that preserve both safety and task-driven behavior.  We demonstrate with a simple proof-of-concept implementation for an object-centric force-based policy trained through reinforcement learning for a movement task of a stationary robot arm that is able to avoid colliding with obstacles on a table top after combining the policy with the safety constraints.  The proposed method can be generalized to more complex specifications and dynamic task settings.

Abstract: Flexible robots hold great promise for enhancing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by providing superior dexterity, precise control, and safe tissue interaction. Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model.

Abstract: Fires in industrial facilities pose special challenges to firefighters, e.g., due to the sheer size and scale of the buildings. The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.
  We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires.

Conclusion: 演示和语言指令携带互补信息，Masked IRL通过结合两者优势，显著提高了样本效率、泛化能力和对模糊语言的鲁棒性

Abstract: Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion requires accurate and globally consistent perception of the surrounding 3D environment. However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.
