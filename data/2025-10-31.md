### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下目标检测的有效性。通过比较标准YOLOv5、时间增强的T-YOLOv5以及添加CBAM模块的T-YOLOv5，发现在动态海洋环境中，时间建模显著提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐进运动条件下，提高检测模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 研究分为两个阶段：第一阶段评估时间增强的T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了添加卷积块注意力模块（CBAM）的T-YOLOv5变体，通过比较三种模型的性能来验证时空建模和注意力机制的有效性。

Result: 测试结果显示，标准YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5 with CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，表现出更高的检测精度和泛化能力。T-YOLOv5 with CBAM在复杂场景中表现更佳，但在简单场景中精度有所下降。

Conclusion: 时空建模显著提升了水下目标检测的可靠性，T-YOLOv5相比标准模型有显著改进，而添加CBAM的T-YOLOv5在挑战性场景中进一步提升了性能，尽管在简单场景中存在精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是事后处理，从而显著提高生成图像质量并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练以实现多样化生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过事后选择生成图像来对齐奖励，但会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是事后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练。

Conclusion: 通过直接在训练中学习用户偏好，MIRO方法在保持多样性和语义保真度的同时，显著提高了图像质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [3] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了针对自行车安全的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，通过领域特定训练显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动自行车日益普及，骑行者面临的安全风险增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台，开发并评估针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes数据集，包含29个动态和静态类别的语义标注。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调的模型达到63.6%的平均交并比(mIoU)，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%结果。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对于自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为面向骑行者的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种机器学习方法，通过物理信息合成数据生成训练流程匹配和扩散模型，用于修复扫描隧道显微镜图像并实现超分辨率，可减少2-4倍图像采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练最先进的流程匹配和扩散模型，利用CLIP最大均值差异和结构相似性等指标进行定量评估。

Result: 模型能有效修复图像，通过从稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力通过减少针尖调节程序频率和增强现有高速STM系统的帧率，显著提高STM实验通量。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的零样本图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、独立计算子流并自适应聚合，解决了现有方法在反转精度和梯度纠缠方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型在图像编辑任务中存在反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题，导致编辑结果无法忠实反映目标提示词。虽然已有方法尝试通过ODE直接映射源和目标分布，但编辑质量仍不理想。

Method: 采用流分解与聚合框架：1）语义分解目标提示词为多个子提示词；2）为每个子提示词计算独立流；3）设计投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解耦方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了图像编辑中的反转精度和梯度纠缠问题，在保持多样性的同时确保语义一致性，为图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过脑交互变换器(BIT)从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，实现了更忠实于实际所见图像的重建效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的fMRI图像重建方法缺乏对实际所见图像的忠实度，需要更有效的脑-图像交互机制

Method: 使用脑交互变换器(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，预测互补的局部图像特征：高层次语义特征和低层次结构特征来引导扩散模型

Result: 方法在视觉和客观指标上都超越了当前最先进方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据就能达到与40小时训练数据相当的效果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑启发的功能簇交互和互补特征预测，实现了更忠实的fMRI图像重建，显著提高了数据效率

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [7] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对TrackRAD2025挑战赛中的实时肿瘤跟踪问题，在数据稀缺约束下，通过基于SAM 2.1基础模型的提示交互分割方法，在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在胸腹部区域cine-MRI序列中进行实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，特别是在强数据稀缺约束下，为MRI引导的放射治疗提供准确跟踪方案。

Method: 采用基于SAM 2.1基础模型的分割方法，使用第一张标注切片进行基于掩码的提示，仅在TrackRAD2025的小标注子集上进行微调，使用1024x1024补丁、标准数据增强和平衡的Dice+IoU损失函数。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice相似系数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第6，训练时间约12小时（RTX A6000, 48GB）。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放射治疗中具有强大的实时肿瘤跟踪潜力，能够在数据稀缺条件下实现准确分割。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Mamba框架的方法，通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，从而更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有Mamba框架在特征空间探索效率和信息一致性方面的问题，同时保持处理长距离依赖关系的能力。

Method: 采用新颖的Hilbert选择性扫描机制，增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，改进空间局部性以捕捉细微的局部交互。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗并缩短了推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术，而且在更广泛的Mamba技术应用领域具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

*Rishika Bhagwatkar,Syrielle Montariol,Angelika Romanou,Beatriz Borges,Irina Rish,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准，支持异常描述、解释和论证三个开放任务，包含细粒度标注，用于评估视觉语言模型在异常检测和理解方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的异常检测仅限于工业缺陷或合成的异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，需要更现实的基准来推动研究。

Method: 构建CAVE基准，包含三个开放任务：异常描述、解释和论证，提供基于认知科学的细粒度标注，包括视觉定位、异常分类、复杂性、严重性和常见性等维度。

Result: 实验表明，即使使用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍然存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE提供了一个现实且基于认知科学的基准，是推动异常检测和视觉语言模型常识推理研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

### [10] [Enhancing Temporal Understanding in Video-LLMs through Stacked Temporal Attention in Vision Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26027)
*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升最高达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，特别是在需要详细理解动作序列和时间进展的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制使模型在将视觉token传递给LLM之前更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试中性能提升最高达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过在视觉编码器中增强时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are
available at: https://alirasekh.github.io/STAVEQ2/.

*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FlexICL框架，通过上下文学习实现超声图像中骨骼区域的自动分割，仅需5%标注数据即可在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上实现鲁棒分割性能，优于现有方法1-27% Dice系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和手腕骨折超声诊断中像素级专家标注耗时且成本高的问题，为轻训练用户提供实时反馈和关键结构突出显示，提高诊断准确性。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法增强模型性能，集成多种增强策略实现有限标注数据下的鲁棒分割。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描上，FlexICL仅需5%训练图像即可超越Painter、MAE-VQGAN、U-Net和TransUNet等最先进方法1-27% Dice系数。

Conclusion: FlexICL作为高效可扩展的超声图像分割解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学成像场景。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

### [12] [Dynamic VLM-Guided Negative Prompting for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26052)
*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的动态负提示方法，在去噪过程中自适应生成负提示，相比传统固定负提示方法能更好地平衡负引导强度与文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的具体上下文进行动态调整，限制了负引导的效果和灵活性。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估表明，该方法在负引导强度和文本-图像对齐之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法通过视觉语言模型的上下文感知能力，显著提升了扩散模型中负提示的有效性和适应性。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [13] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PReMA的新型多模态攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变提示词来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别是在图像编辑应用中构成新的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散模型（如文本到图像模型）在文本和图像模态之间的对齐不足，这种不对齐带来了显著风险，特别是在生成不当或NSFW内容方面。现有攻击方法主要关注生成对抗性提示词，而本文探索仅通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出的可能性。

Method: 提出了Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)方法，通过修改输入图像来操纵生成内容，同时保持提示词不变。该方法在图像修复和风格迁移任务上进行了全面评估。

Result: 在各种模型上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，表明仅通过创建对抗性图像就能成功操纵多模态扩散模型的输出。

Conclusion: PReMA构成了对多模态扩散模型完整性的新型威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中，突显了现有模型在模态对齐方面的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Motivation: 研究视频-LLM在不同视角（第一人称和第三人称）下对同一事件的时间理解是否能够保持一致，解决现有模型在跨视角一致性方面的不足。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的第一人称和第三人称视频对及自然语言查询；提出View-GRPO强化学习框架，在加强特定视角时间推理的同时促进跨视角一致性理解。

Result: 分析发现现有视频-LLM存在两个关键局限：1）模型难以保持一致性，表现远差于单视角；2）简单微调会改善一致性但往往不如单视角训练。View-GRPO方法在改善跨视角一致性方面优于简单SFT和GRPO。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频-LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升模型在保持特定视角推理能力的同时增强跨视角一致性，所有资源将公开提供。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

*Wen Xie,Yanjun Zhu,Gijs Overgoor,Yakov Bart,Agata Lapedriza Garcia,Sarah Ostadabbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频摘要技术的自动视频广告剪辑框架，将视频剪辑定义为专门针对广告的镜头选择问题，强调音频在广告中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告制作需要为同一广告活动制作不同时长的多个版本，这通常需要人工选择和重新编辑长视频广告中的镜头来创建较短版本，过程劳动密集且耗时。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型，预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧在公司制作的短广告中被选中的可能性。为解决缺乏广告特定数据集的问题，提出了AdSum204数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，该模型在平均精度、曲线下面积、Spearman和Kendall等多种指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架首次将视频剪辑作为专门针对广告的镜头选择问题，通过强调音频作用和使用音视频融合模型，实现了优于现有方法的自动广告剪辑性能。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OracleAgent，这是首个专门用于甲骨文结构化管理和检索的智能体系统，通过整合多模态知识库和LLM技术，显著提升了甲骨文研究的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多步骤解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 开发了OracleAgent智能体系统，整合多个甲骨文分析工具，构建了包含140万单字拓片图像和8万条解释文本的多模态知识库，利用大型语言模型灵活编排组件。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务中表现优异，超越主流MLLMs如GPT-4o。案例研究证实能有效协助领域专家，显著降低研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是实现甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统实际部署的重要进展，为文化遗产保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具如COLMAP，这会引入计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 采用解耦的联合优化策略：第一阶段固定姿态通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数；第二阶段使用定制的3D光流算法结合几何和光度约束来优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有的无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超越了基于COLMAP的基准方法。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能够有效处理具有大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差，提供了一种无需预校准输入的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Motivation: 任意尺度视频超分辨率面临空间细节重建、时间一致性和计算复杂度的挑战，需要一种能适应不同缩放因子和应用场景的通用解决方案。

Method: 1) 基于图像拉普拉斯金字塔的自适应多尺度频率先验；2) 流引导传播单元聚合相邻帧的时空信息；3) 二阶运动补偿单元实现更准确的空间对齐；4) 超上采样单元生成尺度感知且内容无关的上采样核。提供三种传播变体：单向RNN（在线推理）、带有限前瞻的单向RNN（容忍小延迟）、双向RNN（离线任务）。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在不同场景下都具有有效性和适应性，在超分辨率质量、泛化能力和推理速度方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BasicAVSR不仅推进了任意尺度视频超分辨率的技术水平，还将其核心组件扩展到多种框架以适应多样化场景。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Conclusion: 该模型仅使用合成文本报告训练，无需真实放射学报告，就能超越现有的全监督或视觉语言模型基线，展示了在医学影像分析中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Motivation: 在南亚国家，机动三轮车是常见交通工具，但交通规则限制其进入某些路线。现有监控系统难以区分机动与非机动三轮车，人工视频分析又耗时，因此需要自动检测方法。

Method: 使用YOLOv8模型进行实时目标检测，准备了包含1,730张标注图像的数据集，涵盖各种交通条件。

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM是一个针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态多轮对话RAG基准测试，包含6.5K个(图像、问题、答案)三元组和2K个基于视觉的多轮对话，涵盖13个领域，其中6.2K张以自我为中心的图像模拟可穿戴设备拍摄。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态检索增强生成(MM-RAG)任务的全面基准测试，需要填补这一空白以支持智能眼镜等设备的信息查询需求。

Method: 构建包含多样化图像、问题和答案的数据集，设计五种图像质量问题、六种问题类型、不同实体流行度、信息动态性和对话轮次，提供图像-KG检索和网页检索API，并设计三个任务：单源增强、多源增强和多轮对话。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准测试揭示了当前多模态RAG方法在可穿戴设备场景下的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要的评估框架和挑战方向。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）通常质量较低，即粗粒度和不准确。需要开发能够估计高质量高分辨率运动轨迹的方法。

Method: 提出了MoTDiff框架，包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）新的训练方法，促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径的整体形状和位置，以及沿运动轨迹的像素连通性。

Result: 实验证明，MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中能够超越最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MoTDiff是首个能够从单张运动模糊图像估计高质量高分辨率运动轨迹的扩散模型框架，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器从视觉基础模型中提取可解释概念，用于发现和量化数据集中的偏差，包括目标、上下文和偏见概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据偏差，但缺乏细粒度属性标注使得系统识别这些偏差变得困难且成本高昂。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器在视觉基础模型表示上训练，发现人类可解释概念，并根据语义相关性和统计相关性将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏见类型。

Result: ConceptScope能捕捉广泛的视觉概念，可靠检测已知偏差并发现未标注的偏差，概念激活产生与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够进行类级数据集表征、偏差识别和基于概念的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和现有方法在复杂领域表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档AI发展迅速，但大多数研究集中在文档布局分析上，而文档布局生成领域仍未被充分探索。主要障碍在于缺乏多样化的布局数据：现有研究主要关注学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，而报纸、杂志等开放世界类型的文档布局严重不足。

Method: 1) 构建了首个百万规模的多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，涵盖六种常见文档类型；2) 提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型（0.5B参数），采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：首先从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，然后将知识迁移到具有细粒度注释的特定领域。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成领域的数据稀缺和复杂领域布局生成问题，为文档AI的发展提供了重要支持。代码、模型和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了现代视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向（前进或后退）方面的能力，发现大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，远落后于人类水平，揭示了模型在时间连续性和因果理解方面的根本缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但在视频时间信息理解方面存在明显不足且缺乏充分评估。研究者希望通过判断视频时间方向这一简单但具有揭示性的挑战来探究这一差距。

Method: 研究者引入了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，该基准使用与人类研究相同的刺激物和行为基线，评估模型在自然视频中推断时间方向的能力，涵盖了物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（如除法/加法）。

Result: 对开源和专有、推理和非推理视觉语言模型的全面评估显示，大多数模型表现接近随机水平，即使在物理不可逆过程和因果手动动作等人类几乎能立即识别的任务上，最佳模型也远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然它们能够捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。研究者发布AoT-PsyPhyBENCH的代码和数据，以促进视觉语言模型在物理和时间推理能力方面的进一步发展。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，显式地在流匹配过程中施加约束，确保生成的轨迹遵守安全和运动学规则；同时参数化驾驶激进程度作为生成过程中的控制信号。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中获得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG框架有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式崩溃问题，能够生成多样化且符合约束的轨迹，并通过参数化控制实现轨迹风格的精确操控。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RobustVLA方法，针对VLA模型的多模态扰动鲁棒性问题，通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性约束，在17种扰动下显著提升了模型性能，特别是在真实机器人场景中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观测等多模态扰动的鲁棒性问题，这在实际部署中至关重要。

Method: 提出RobustVLA方法：1）输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况的动作噪声；2）输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持动作一致性；3）将鲁棒性建模为多臂老虎机问题，使用置信上界算法自动识别最有害噪声。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效解决了VLA模型的多模态鲁棒性问题，特别是在资源受限的真实机器人场景中表现出色，为VLA模型的实际部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模场景、动态环境和严格约束下的敏捷对地观测卫星星座调度时存在局限性，需要更现实的解决方案。

Method: 开发了AEOS-Bench基准套件（包含3,907个卫星资源和16,410个场景），并提出了基于Transformer的AEOS-Former调度模型，采用约束感知注意力机制和内部约束模块。

Result: AEOS-Former在任务完成率和能源效率方面优于基线模型，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架为敏捷对地观测卫星星座调度提供了首个大规模基准和有效的深度学习方法，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Motivation: 现有的EEG驱动图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，限制了重建图像的保真度和语义一致性。

Method: 采用双条件框架，结合ATM进行EEG特征提取，通过LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1实现神经信号与视觉语义的对齐，并使用ControlNet分支基于显著性图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量方面相比现有方法有显著提升，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG的模糊性问题，实现高保真度的图像重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中具有应用前景，通过高效适应预训练扩散模型推进了神经解码技术。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门为事件相机设计的事件标记化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但破坏了事件的异步性和空间稀疏性。目标是找到一种既能保持事件相机独特属性又不牺牲精度的事件表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches标记化方法，将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记表示。使用GNN、PCN和Transformer在姿态识别和物体检测任务上评估该方法。

Result: Spiking Patches标记的推理速度比体素标记快3.4倍，比帧快10.4倍。在保持精度的同时，姿态识别精度提升3.8，物体检测精度提升1.4。

Conclusion: 标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性的方法迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要关注简化的提示语和低级指标，忽视了与提示语的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，需要专门针对长视频复杂生成的评估基准。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示语，建立多维度评估框架，包括新提出的指标：事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度以及关注叙事流、情感响应和角色发展的人类期望实现度(HERD)。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型进行全面评估，发现当前方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题一致性等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长形式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Motivation: 现有基础3D重建模型在静态场景的2D和3D对应关系方面表现出色，但尚未充分应用于点跟踪任务。论文旨在将这些模型适配用于动态点跟踪，解决现有方法在动态场景中的局限性。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应关系训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调。仅在包含查询点的帧对上进行训练和评估，移除时间上下文依赖。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的点跟踪结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率（对比CoTracker2的75.7/88.3%）；在EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2，RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: 通过将基础3D重建模型适配用于点跟踪任务，并采用动态对应关系训练策略，能够实现高效且准确的点跟踪，特别是在动态场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本异常检测方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型的泛化能力，但由于缺乏详细的文本描述，只能预定义图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁标记，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义不对齐，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述（MFSC）为异常检测数据集提供多级细粒度文本描述；提出FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示（MLLP）和多级语义对齐（MLSA）两个组件，通过自动替换和连接机制引入细粒度语义，并设计区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练。

Result: 实验证明，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的少样本设置下，FineGrainedAD实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入多级细粒度语义描述和改进的语义对齐方法，FineGrainedAD有效解决了语义不对齐问题，显著提升了少样本异常检测的定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中的对象-上下文捷径问题会降低零样本可靠性，当测试场景与训练共现模式不同时，模型容易产生错误预测。作者将此问题重新定义为因果推理问题。

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过从外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述中采样多样替代上下文，合成反事实嵌入。使用总直接效应估计和干预模拟，减去仅背景激活，保留有益的对象-上下文交互。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了一条实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过分布重塑和轨迹重采样策略有效解决了自改进过程中的马太效应问题，显著提升了模型在复杂视觉推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Conclusion: 扩展搜索空间策略不适用于该图像集，检测器具有良好的适应性但迁移学习效果有限。

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios

the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过轻量级模块提升VQA模型的泛化能力，无需重新训练主干模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医学影像、数学图表等跨域场景下泛化能力显著下降，现有方法依赖按域微调或定制化流程，成本高且不灵活。

Method: 提出CATCH框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，引入两个轻量级模块：域分类器识别输入图像类型，双适配器机制包含用于语言调制的提示适配器和用于视觉特征调整的视觉适配器，通过统一钩子接口动态注入。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU提升2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA得分提升2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE提升3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Emu3.5是一个大规模多模态世界模型，通过统一的下一标记预测目标在超过10万亿标记的视觉-语言交织数据上进行预训练，能够自然地处理交织的视觉-语言输入并生成相应的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够原生预测视觉和语言下一状态的多模态世界模型，以支持长序列视觉-语言生成、任意到图像生成和复杂文本丰富图像生成等能力。

Method: 采用端到端的下一标记预测预训练，使用视觉-语言交织数据；通过大规模强化学习进行后训练以增强多模态推理和生成；提出离散扩散适应（DiDA）方法将逐标记解码转换为双向并行预测，提升推理效率。

Conclusion: Emu3.5是一个强大的多模态世界模型，在多种任务上表现出色，并通过开源支持社区研究。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种新的计算超分辨率方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验，在BioSR数据集上表现优异，在数据保真度和感知真实性之间达到最佳平衡，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光显微镜中的计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动机器学习技术的发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: 提出ResMatching方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4个不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法比较，ResMatching始终获得竞争性结果，在所有情况下都表现出数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡，特别是在低分辨率图像噪声较多时效果显著。

Conclusion: ResMatching是一种有效的计算超分辨率方法，能够学习强数据先验，在噪声环境下表现优异，并能提供校准的不确定性估计来指导用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 该论文首次大规模评估了48种深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的性能，多个模型实现了亚千米级精度，证明了深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。虽然光流技术在计算机视觉领域发展迅速，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用48种深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS追踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型实现了亚千米级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），相对于海冰运动的空间尺度和北极典型导航需求来说误差很小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效迁移到极地遥感应用，提供空间连续的漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the
computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting
scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources.
By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteerVLM是一个轻量级的转向模块，通过动态调整视觉语言模型中语言模态与图像上下文之间的激活连接，实现推理时对复杂输出语义的细粒度控制，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遵循特定指令方面存在不足，需要一种轻量级方法来引导模型输出更好地符合期望指令，同时保持非目标任务的性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应转向来动态调整激活连接，无需预提取静态向量或手动调整干预点。

Result: 转向模块仅需学习原始VLM大小0.14%的参数，在转向和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，同时保持非目标任务的性能。

Conclusion: SteerVLM通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，并引入了VNIA数据集来促进VLM转向技术的开发和评估。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件视频修复模型，从随意拍摄的视频中合成时空4D内容，避免了传统方法对相机姿态标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法需要手动标注相机姿态，这在野外拍摄素材中既费时又不可靠。虽然最近的方法通过变形-修复策略减少了对姿态标签的需求，但轨迹到轨迹的公式化方法往往将相机运动与场景动态混在一起，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机库的渲染替代显式轨迹预测，将相机控制与场景建模分离。训练视图条件视频修复模型，通过学习几何先验来修复遮挡或缺失区域，无需显式3D标注。基于此核心设计时空自回归推理流水线，遍历虚拟相机样条线并扩展视频。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，该方法在定量指标和定性评估上都优于基于姿态或轨迹条件的基线方法，实现了更好的泛化能力和性能提升。

Conclusion: SEE4D通过分离相机控制和场景建模，以及强大的修复核心，推进了从随意视频进行实用4D世界建模的能力，在无需昂贵3D监督的情况下实现了高质量的时空内容合成。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Motivation: 旨在开发一种不依赖序列中标记位置的视觉学习信号强度的特征学习方法，减少对辅助目标的需求，与自回归方法相比提供更均匀的学习信号。

Method: 使用图像条件掩码扩散语言模型，在训练过程中随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，训练视觉特征条件解码器重建原始文本，学习到的视觉特征可用于下游视觉任务。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，该方法学习的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散字幕（MDC）是一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，能够产生与现有方法相竞争的视觉表示，且不依赖序列位置信息。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Method: 通过构建MME-CoF基准数据集，从12个维度（空间、几何、物理、时间等）系统评估Veo-3模型的推理行为，分析其优势和失败模式。

Result: 视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致性动态方面表现出有希望的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为可靠的独立零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

### [53] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了StreetMath基准来评估大语言模型在现实世界近似计算场景中的能力，发现LLMs在需要近似推理的任务中仍倾向于计算精确值或调用外部工具，且近似和精确算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大语言模型在精确算术运算上的表现，但对其在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，在不同LLM架构上进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术探测其内部计算状态。

Result: LLMs在需要近似推理的任务中仍倾向于计算精确值或调用外部工具；模型有时在早期层或步骤就能得到正确答案，但在解决近似任务时仍消耗更多token；精确和近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在街头数学场景中并不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，近似推理能力有待改进。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的细粒度情感分析方法，用于对实体评论进行强度分级和排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于词典的情感分析方法无法区分意见的强度等级，如非常强烈、强烈、中等、非常弱和弱等不同程度的正面或负面情感。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑算法将意见词分类到不同强度等级，并使用句法依赖解析找到与特定产品方面相关的意见词关系。

Result: 通过考虑与特定方面相关的意见词来计算实体在该方面的得分，实现更精确的情感强度分析。

Conclusion: 该方法能够对实体评论进行更细粒度的情感强度分类和排名，提供更准确的情感分析结果。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标依赖的立场检测任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，难以在韩语等低资源语言中开发模型，特别是在新兴的立场检测领域。

Method: 从韩国政党的新闻稿中收集数据，构建包含563,299个标注句子的LASTIST数据集，并训练了最先进的深度学习和立场检测模型。

Result: 成功构建了大规模韩语立场检测数据集LASTIST，支持目标无关立场检测和历时演化立场检测等多种任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集填补了韩语立场检测的研究空白，为低资源语言的立场检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA，一种零延迟融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了当前适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署时使用任务特定适配器，但这些适配器参数虽然只占基础模型的不到1%，却会导致推理时间显著增加（高达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 开发零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外计算延迟。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的LLM上实验表明，zFLoRA在18个不同任务上表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调。在NPU和GPU平台上测量显示零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA提供了一种高效的适配器解决方案，在保持性能的同时消除了推理延迟问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种改进电路发现的方法：使用自助法识别具有一致归因分数的边、引入基于比率的策略选择强正分数边、用整数线性规划替换贪心选择。这些方法在多个MIB任务和模型上产生了更忠实的电路并优于先前方法。


<details>

Motivation: 机制可解释性的主要挑战之一是电路发现，即确定模型的哪些部分执行给定任务。本文基于机制可解释性基准(MIB)，旨在改进电路发现方法。

Method: 1. 使用自助法识别具有一致归因分数的边；2. 引入基于比率的简单选择策略，优先选择强正分数边，平衡性能和忠实度；3. 用整数线性规划公式替换标准贪心选择。

Result: 所提出的方法在多个MIB任务和模型上产生了更忠实的电路，并优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合自助法、比率选择策略和整数线性规划，本文成功改进了电路发现方法，提高了电路的忠实度和性能表现。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: LISTEN框架使用大型语言模型作为零样本偏好预测器，通过自然语言描述专家优先级来指导多目标决策，提出了LISTEN-U（参数化效用函数）和LISTEN-T（非参数化锦标赛选择）两种迭代算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类专家在多个竞争目标下从大量选项中选择最佳方案的困难，特别是难以形式化复杂隐含偏好的问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为零样本偏好预测器，基于专家自然语言优先级指导；提出LISTEN-U（参数化效用函数优化）和LISTEN-T（非参数化锦标赛选择）两种迭代算法来应对LLM的上下文窗口和推理成本限制。

Result: 在航班预订、购物和考试安排等多样化任务上的评估显示，当偏好参数化对齐时LISTEN-U表现优异，而LISTEN-T提供更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作探索了直接用自然语言指导复杂多目标决策的有前景方向，减轻了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter框架通过对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异，筛选出具有有意义长距离依赖的训练数据，用于长上下文预训练。实验表明该方法能有效提升模型在长上下文基准测试上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据中大部分缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，训练效率低下，因此需要精心筛选数据以提高长上下文预训练的效果。

Method: 提出LongFilter框架，通过测量扩展上下文提供的信息增益来识别长距离依赖至关重要的样本，具体方法是对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter为长上下文预训练提供了一种有效的数据筛选方法，能够识别并利用具有重要长距离依赖的训练样本，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型在内容审核中使用不同意识形态角色时，会表现出系统性偏见，虽然整体分类准确率变化不大，但不同意识形态的角色在判断内容有害性时存在显著差异，模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在内容审核系统中使用角色扮演时可能引入的意识形态偏见，确保AI系统的公平性和中立性。

Method: 通过分析不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态下，角色采纳对有害内容分类一致性和公平性的影响，包括协议分析和针对政治任务的研究。

Result: 不同意识形态的角色在判断内容有害性时表现出明显差异，模型特别是大型模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致，强化了意识形态内部的一致性，同时扩大了意识形态群体间的分歧。

Conclusion: 角色调节可能在LLM输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，引发对AI系统在伪装中立下强化党派观点的担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床文档以base64编码附件形式存储，使得语义问答变得困难，传统向量数据库方法常常遗漏微妙的临床关系。

Method: 开发了临床笔记问答评估平台，验证CLEAR方法对比零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成方法。在12个包含10,000到65,000个token的临床笔记上进行测试。

Result: CLEAR获得58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理少用78%的token。在超过65,000个token的长文档上表现最佳，胜率达75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索提高了临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用和透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

TL;DR: 本文通过系统消融研究量化了CORE-KG框架中两个关键组件（共指解析模块和结构化提示）对从法律文本构建知识图谱的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从复杂法律文档构建知识图谱时面临的节点重复和噪声问题，这些文档通常是非结构化、词汇密集且包含模糊或变化的指代。

Method: 对CORE-KG框架进行系统消融研究，分别评估移除共指解析模块和结构化提示对知识图谱质量的影响。

Result: 移除共指解析导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示对减少噪声节点更有效，而共指解析对减少节点重复更关键，这为设计基于LLM的复杂法律文本结构化提取管道提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM应用在语言资源和数据集创建中替代人类劳动已成为现实，但其在标注数据集创建中的性能和影响，特别是从NLP视角出发的全面评估仍然缺乏。

Method: 采用比较方法，在三种实验设置（手动、自动和半自动）下评估标注时间、覆盖率和多样性，使用基于LLM的语义角色标注器进行FrameNet式语义标注。

Result: 混合半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了框架多样性并保持相似标注覆盖率，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在保持标注质量的同时提高了效率，展示了LLM在语义标注任务中的实用价值，但纯自动方法仍需改进。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了多语言预训练中的常见假设，发现在1.1B和3B参数规模的LLM中，增加训练语言数量（25-400种）不会显著降低性能，英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处，且适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强模型能力而不损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间的权衡（即多语言诅咒）这一持续争议话题。

Method: 训练1.1B和3B参数的LLM，使用不同的多语言语料库，语言数量从25到400种变化，研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用以及不同语系语言的选择效果。

Result: 1) 英语和多语言数据结合不会降低任一组的语言内性能，前提是语言在预训练语料中有足够token；2) 英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处；3) 在此规模模型中没有观察到显著的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源设置下也是如此，挑战了关于多语言训练中性能权衡的传统观念。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译在低资源语言中生成合成数据时，由于文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域，LLMs会编码文化知识并放大这种漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保持的影响，因为文化差异可能导致翻译过程中的标签漂移或改变。

Method: 通过一系列跨文化敏感和中性领域的实验，分析不同机器翻译系统（包括现代LLMs）在翻译过程中的标签漂移现象。

Result: 发现：(1)机器翻译系统（包括LLMs）在翻译过程中会导致标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2)与早期统计机器翻译工具不同，LLMs编码文化知识并会放大标签漂移；(3)源语言和目标语言之间的文化相似性是标签保持的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素不仅会削弱标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提高了LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成导致未经验证和算术上不可靠的解决方案，现有提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号引擎对LLM推理进行确定性验证。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，且具有更高的标记效率。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理基于确定性符号引擎，代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键步骤，将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器设计了高性能矩阵乘法内核，通过定制化技术优化LLM推理性能，相比AWS现有实现平均提升1.35倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为AI工作负载提供了成本效益和高性能解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性，特别是在LLM推理中的矩阵乘法关键计算内核上。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略的系列定制化技术，减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，矩阵乘法内核平均实现1.35倍加速（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均实现1.66倍加速（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 提出的定制化技术显著提升了Trainium上矩阵乘法的性能，为LLM推理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: AttnCache是一个加速LLM预填充阶段推理的框架，通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来减少自注意力计算的开销，在CPU和GPU上分别实现了1.2倍和1.6倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载仅依赖LLM的预填充阶段，其中自注意力计算因序列长度的二次复杂度成为主要性能瓶颈。研究发现语义不同的句子在不同层和头中往往产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效的缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理过程中识别并重用预缓存的相似注意力图，从而减少自注意力计算开销。

Result: 实验结果显示，AttnCache在CPU上实现了平均1.2倍端到端和2倍注意力加速，在GPU上实现了1.6倍端到端和3倍注意力加速，且精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AttnCache通过重用相似注意力图有效加速了LLM预填充阶段的推理性能，为解决自注意力计算瓶颈提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的工具使用LLM训练方法，通过探索多种工具调用轨迹来提升在动态环境中的性能，相比静态数据集训练有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态数据集训练的工具使用LLM只能模仿通用的工具调用流程，无法探索可能的解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现有限。

Method: 提出PORTool强化学习方法：1）为给定查询生成多个工具调用轨迹，形成树状结构；2）基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力为每个步骤分配奖励；3）使用步骤奖励计算分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势来训练LLM。

Result: 实验使用17个工具处理用户查询，涵盖时间敏感和不敏感主题。与其它训练方法相比，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种工具调用轨迹，有效提升了LLM在动态工具调用环境中的性能，证明了步骤奖励设计的必要性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了跨语言对齐(CLA)在促进知识转移的同时可能导致文化擦除的问题，提出了转移-本地化平面评估框架，并基于模型内部表示分析开发了Surgical Steering方法来解决这一权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐旨在对齐多语言表示，但可能无意中导致文化擦除，即丧失提供基于查询语言的文化情境化响应的能力。本文旨在系统分析这种权衡关系。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架量化知识转移和文化擦除；分析模型内部表示；提出Surgical Steering推理时方法，通过在不同模型层应用定向激活引导来分离两个目标。

Result: 重新评估现有CLA方法发现它们一致地以牺牲文化本地化为代价改善事实转移；发现通用事实转移和文化特定知识在不同模型层具有最优可控性；Surgical Steering方法在六个语言中实现了两个竞争维度间的更好平衡。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐存在知识转移与文化本地化的权衡，通过层特异性激活引导可以有效克服当前对齐技术的局限性，实现更好的平衡。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了一个基于自然语言处理的工具，用于识别放射学报告中的偶发甲状腺发现，发现7.8%的患者存在偶发甲状腺发现，这些发现与甲状腺癌过度诊断相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非甲状腺指征的影像学检查增多，偶发甲状腺发现的检出率上升，但其流行率、特征和临床后果尚不明确，需要系统性评估。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用基于transformer的自然语言处理管道从多模态影像报告中识别偶发甲状腺发现并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有偶发甲状腺发现，其中92.9%为结节。这些发现与更高的甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除和甲状腺癌诊断几率相关。

Conclusion: 偶发甲状腺发现常见且与导致小、低风险癌症检测的级联效应密切相关，强调了标准化报告和选择性随访的必要性。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

TL;DR: QCoder Benchmark是一个评估大语言模型在量子编程任务中性能的框架，通过量子模拟器环境提供领域特定反馈，并使用真实编程竞赛中的人类代码作为基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）中的代码生成能力尚未得到充分探索，因此需要专门的评估框架。

Method: 开发了QCoder Benchmark评估框架，支持量子模拟器环境评估，提供电路深度、执行时间和错误分类等领域特定指标反馈，并整合真实编程竞赛中的人类代码提交。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在量子编程任务中准确率仅为18.97%，而基于推理的模型如o3达到78%准确率，超过了人类代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: 量子编程对大语言模型具有挑战性，基于推理的模型表现优于传统模型，QCoder Benchmark数据集和公共评估API的发布将支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"一题多解"（1PNS）训练范式，通过引入推理路径差异（RPD）度量来增加模型输出的多样性，从而提高测试时缩放（TTS）的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的"一题一解"（1P1S）训练方式导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时缩放的效果。为了解决这个问题，需要让模型接触多种有效的推理路径。

Method: 提出了推理路径差异（RPD）度量来量化多步思维链之间的语义差异，并使用RPD为每个问题选择最大多样性的解决方案集来微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，RPD选择的训练集能产生更多样化的输出和更高的pass@k性能，在pass@16上平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能够显著增强TTS的有效性，通过增加推理路径的多样性来提升模型性能。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中存在统计效率不足的问题，需要减少弃权率并提高生成质量。

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在训练过程中引入SDM激活层进行二元分类，采用对比输入编码方案和在线生成的硬负样本，优化下一个标记的监督损失。

Result: 相比强监督基线，SDM语言模型显著减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型能够有效提升预训练语言模型的指令遵循能力，通过SDM激活层实现更好的校准和高概率区域生成。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来实现软语义排序，从而提升控制性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际控制性方面存在脆弱性，主要问题是更新遗忘现象——均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。这可以作为固定策略或由任务信号驱动的自适应策略实现。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA实现了超过20%的准确率提升，困惑度几乎减半，且使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GlobalQA——首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准，并提出GlobalRAG框架来解决现有方法在全局任务上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG，但许多实际应用需要全局RAG能力，即跨整个文档集合聚合和分析信息以获得语料库级别的洞察。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档，并整合聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG显著提升了全局RAG任务的性能，为解决跨文档信息聚合的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 准确理解隐含意义在人类沟通中至关重要，语言模型也应具备这种能力。研究旨在探索如何通过语用学理论指导来增强语言模型的语用推理能力。

Method: 提出将格莱斯语用学和关联理论等语用学理论概述作为提示，引导语言模型进行逐步推理以得出最终解释。与仅提示中间推理的零样本思维链基线方法进行比较。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比基线方法，使用语用学理论提示的方法在语用推理任务上性能提升高达9.6%。即使在提示中仅提及语用学理论名称而不详细解释，在较大模型中也能带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 提供语用学理论作为提示是一种有效的上下文学习方法，能够显著提升语言模型理解隐含意义的能力，且简单提及理论名称也能带来一定性能改善。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练语言模型能否像人类一样识别借词，发现在10种语言上模型表现不佳，存在对借词的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备识别借词的能力，特别是在双语社区中保护少数民族语言免受主流语言词汇压力的背景下。

Method: 评估了包括大语言模型在内的多个模型在10种语言上的借词识别能力，使用显式指令和上下文信息进行测试。

Result: 尽管提供了明确的指令和上下文信息，模型在区分借词和本土词汇方面表现不佳，证实了现代NLP系统对借词存在偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具和支持在主流语言词汇压力下的语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 本文研究了知识蒸馏在视觉语言模型多语言压缩中的行为，发现不同蒸馏方法对跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间性能不均，模型压缩时问题加剧。知识蒸馏在跨语言应用中的效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 对五种蒸馏方法进行受控实证研究，在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上评估，涵盖领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务。

Result: 某些配置在模型尺寸减半时仍能保持甚至提升多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他方法无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了设计敏感的权衡。

Conclusion: 仅靠聚合准确率无法完全揭示知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中的复杂行为，需要更细致的评估方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经元激活的内部信号分析方法（NAD），通过分析激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来无监督地选择最佳候选答案，显著减少token使用量并实现早期正确性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的样本-评估-集成解码器主要依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），但这些信号在训练后可能校准不良。作者发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，能够提供更可靠的指导。

Method: 提出神经元一致性解码（NAD）方法，通过分析神经元激活的稀疏性和跨样本一致性来选择最佳候选答案，完全基于内部信号且不需要可比较的文本输出。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中，NAD与多数投票方法表现相当；在开放式编码基准测试中，NAD始终优于Avg@64。通过早期停止，NAD将token使用量减少了99%，且生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，神经元激活分析是实现高效推理的重要途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么不同LLMs在数字输入嵌入表示上收敛到相似且准确的结果，但却在处理数字信息时产生错误输出之间的冲突。

Method: 探索语言模型如何操作数字，量化这些机制的准确度下限，创建通用探针来追踪信息（包括输出错误的原因）到特定层。

Result: 发现不同语言模型学习到了可互换的数字表示，这些表示是系统化、高度准确且普遍存在的，允许创建通用探针并追踪错误到特定层。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLMs如何操作数字提供了基本理解，并概述了更准确的探针技术在改进LLMs架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出色，但其在动态交互环境中的能力尚未充分探索，因此使用网页游戏作为测试场景进行评估

Method: 使用Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world等浏览器游戏作为测试场景，以游戏内性能得分作为量化指标评估不同任务类型的表现

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，往往无法通过初始障碍

Conclusion: Atlas虽然具备强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在明显局限性

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: SCRIBE是一个用于教育反馈的工具增强推理框架，通过多跳推理和工具使用生成有效的学生反馈，在3B和8B小模型上实现与大模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署面临的隐私担忧、计算资源限制和教学有效性三大挑战，需要能在本地运行且能可靠基于正确信息生成反馈的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具与自反式推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型语言模型的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER方法通过自动生成基于布鲁姆分类法的课程，将通用大语言模型转化为领域专家，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升专业领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在经济学、心理学等需要深度原理性理解的专业领域表现不佳，存在关键领域差距。

Method: ACER首先为特定学科生成教科书式的目录，然后基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对，确保系统性的主题覆盖和渐进式难度提升。使用合成的语料库进行交错课程安排的持续预训练。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，ACER在专业MMLU子集上显著提升，微观经济学准确率提高5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点。非目标领域也提升0.7点，在ARC和GPQA基准上提升超过2个绝对点。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一个可扩展且有效的方法来缩小大语言模型在关键领域的差距，同时防止灾难性遗忘并促进跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关的错误信息非常普遍且具有潜在危害，特别是那些歪曲或误解科学发现的声明难以识别。现有标注数据资源有限，需要有效方法来增强模型识别谬误论点的能力。

Method: 提出MisSynth管道，应用检索增强生成(RAG)技术生成合成谬误样本，然后使用这些样本对LLM模型进行轻量级微调。

Result: 微调后的模型相比原始基线取得显著准确率提升。例如，LLaMA 3.1 8B微调模型在MISSCI测试集上比原始基线F1分数绝对提升超过35%。

Conclusion: 通过引入合成谬误数据来增强有限的标注资源，可以显著提升LLM在真实世界科学错误信息任务上的零样本分类性能，即使在有限计算资源下也能实现。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Motivation: 多智能体方法基于大语言模型是超越单个模型能力的有前景策略，但其成功关键依赖于协同团队组成。然而，形成最优团队具有挑战性，因为大多数模型的不透明性掩盖了有效协作所需的内部特征。

Method: 构建语言模型图来映射模型间关系，基于成对对话的语义一致性；应用社区检测识别协同模型集群；通过特定主题引导对话来识别协同团队。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够发现功能一致的模型组，反映了它们的潜在专业化。识别出的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，并达到与基于已知模型专业化的手动策划团队相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新的基础，证明了无需先验知识的交互中心方法能够有效识别协同模型组合。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI在科学工作流程中的广泛应用，需要利用话语层面的信息来为AI生成的科学主张提供支持证据，而理解科学写作中的话语结构是实现这一目标的第一步。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型和大语言模型进行话语关系分类，特别关注科学出版物这一较少研究的文本类型，并分析上下文（定义为话语结构）对分类任务的影响。

Result: 实验表明，基于话语结构的上下文信息通常有助于话语关系分类任务，并识别了哪些科学话语关系类型最能从上下文中受益。

Conclusion: 上下文信息在科学话语关系分类中具有重要作用，为使用话语层面信息支持AI生成科学主张的后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to

  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs和基准测试主要关注知识维度，忽视了教育场景中重要的素养能力评估，且在中文语境下缺乏多样性。

Method: 构建OmniEduBench基准测试，包含24.602K问答对，分为知识维度（18.121K）和素养维度（6.481K），各细分为6个类别，覆盖61个学科和11种题型。对11个主流LLMs进行广泛实验评估。

Result: 知识维度中仅Gemini-2.5 Pro准确率超过60%，素养维度表现最好的QWQ模型仍落后人类智能近30%。

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用中仍有显著改进空间，特别是在素养能力方面面临挑战，OmniEduBench为全面评估LLMs教育能力提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但部署面临带宽和计算需求大的限制。现有方法如剪枝和低秩逼近各有优势，但二者的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于理论分析，将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法求解，结合两种技术的优势：低秩逼近保留基本结构，稀疏优化去除非关键权重。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上的实验表明，SSLC无需额外训练步骤，始终优于单独方法，达到最先进结果。Qwen2.5压缩50%无性能下降，至少1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: SSLC为大语言模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案，通过协同稀疏和低秩压缩实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Motivation: 希伯来语变音符号恢复对于确保准确发音和消除文本歧义至关重要，尽管未变音文本存在高度歧义性，但机器学习方法已显著提升该任务性能。

Method: 将任务构建为基于上下文条件的零样本分类问题，使用希伯来视觉语言模型将未变音文本作为图像处理，从动态生成的候选集中选择最合适的变音模式。

Result: 在"oracle"设置下（正确变音形式保证在候选集中），系统达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在准确自动化希伯来语变音符号恢复方面展现出巨大潜力，无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，强化学习面临奖励密度低的挑战，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励，这阻碍了RLVR方法的实际应用。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用精炼智能体压缩搜索历史，减轻探索认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow框架通过系统性方法有效解决了奖励密度优化问题，为强化学习在深度搜索场景中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to

TL;DR: CAST是一种新的动态树解码方法，通过考虑GPU配置和批大小等推理成本因素来动态优化树结构，在大语言模型推理中实现高达5.2倍的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型面临自回归设计和庞大尺寸带来的显著推理延迟问题，现有推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3虽然使用动态树结构改进推测解码，但往往忽略了GPU设备和批大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批大小等因素）来动态优化树结构。

Result: 在六个不同任务和六个不同大语言模型上的综合实验表明，该方法比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，并且通常比现有最先进技术性能提升5%到20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统级推理成本因素来动态优化树结构，能够显著提升大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了编码器-解码器架构的LLM（RedLLM），将其与当前主流的仅解码器架构（DecLLM）进行对比分析，发现RedLLM在指令调优后在下游任务上表现相当甚至更好，且推理效率显著更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速从编码器-解码器架构转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从缩放角度的严谨比较分析，可能低估了编码器-解码器模型的潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，使用因果语言建模预训练DecLLM，在150M到8B不同规模模型上进行全面比较，使用RedPajama V1（1.6T tokens）进行预训练，FLAN进行指令调优。

Result: RedLLM展现出令人信服的缩放特性和强大的性能。虽然DecLLM在预训练期间计算效率更高，但RedLLM具有相当的缩放和上下文长度外推能力。指令调优后，RedLLM在各种下游任务上达到相当甚至更好的结果，同时推理效率显著更高。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器LLM具有被低估的潜力，值得重新审视，为开发强大且高效的LLM提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree框架利用少量高质量本体规则从LLMs中系统提取、验证和增强领域知识，无需大量外部数据集，在医疗QA基准测试中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业化应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: 从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线持续表现更优，准确率最高提升3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应方面具有有效性、高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较下超越全注意力机制，核心是Kimi Delta Attention模块，通过精细门控机制和优化的DPLR矩阵实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种既能超越全注意力性能又能显著降低KV缓存使用和提高解码吞吐量的线性注意力架构，特别是在长上下文和强化学习场景中。

Method: 采用Kimi Delta Attention扩展Gated DeltaNet，结合精细门控机制和优化的Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank过渡矩阵，使用层间混合KDA和Multi-Head Latent Attention。

Result: 3B激活参数的Kimi Linear在所有评估任务中显著超越全MLA，减少KV缓存使用达75%，在1M上下文下实现6倍解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可以作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，提供更优的性能和效率，特别是在长输入输出任务中。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一种新型架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头部，使模型能够动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，实现真正的端到端生成，无需手动调整解码超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的"端到端"标签存在误导性，实际依赖非可微的解码过程，需要手动调整温度、top-p等超参数，这过程繁琐且需要专业知识。

Method: 在标准transformer架构上添加轻量级头部，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值以及下一个token的logits，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且达到了与通过"篡改测试集"获得的oracle调优基线相当的性能，这是任何静态方法的实际上限。

Conclusion: AutoDeco实现了真正的端到端生成，并展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，能够根据自然语言命令调整预测的温度和top-p值，为可操控和交互式LLM解码开辟了新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在训练过程中如何学习人类价值观对齐，发现监督微调阶段主要确立模型价值观，而后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要研究它们如何学习与人类价值体系对齐，而现有工作主要关注已训练好的模型，忽视了训练动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模的模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，分析价值观对齐的出现时机和程度，并使用合成偏好数据集进行受控实验。

Result: 监督微调阶段通常确立模型的价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观；不同的偏好优化算法即使在相同偏好数据下也会产生不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解价值观在训练过程中的学习机制提供了可操作的见解，有助于指导数据筛选以及选择适合的模型和算法来改进与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度或更高的人类编写问题，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准因性能饱和而难以有效评估顶级LLMs，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动数学推理能力的发展。

Method: 创建50道经过专家交叉验证、达到IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案以便自动评分。

Result: 在26个LLMs上的实验显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但发现测试时计算增加时的有希望的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在数学推理方面仍有显著改进空间，AMO-Bench的发布将促进语言模型推理能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 现实世界中的机器人系统需要语义理解环境以确定安全行动，因此需要开发能够感知风险的数学表示方法。

Method: 采用两步法：1）通过泊松方程的狄利克雷问题生成安全函数；2）通过拉普拉斯方程的狄利克雷问题合成安全引导场，使用可调通量边界条件编码障碍物周围的可变谨慎级别。

Result: 安全函数和引导场结合定义安全约束，合成风险感知安全过滤器，在仿真中验证了该方法能够生成风险感知的安全行为。

Conclusion: 该方法能够将障碍物风险的事先理解直接整合到安全过滤器中，生成既保证安全又风险感知的行为。

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a
representation--specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are
risk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding
of the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace
guidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's
equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its
0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's
equation to synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable
levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary
condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define
a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which,
given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于欧拉轴-角信息的姿态控制方法，相比传统的四元数控制方法，能够保证闭环系统存在唯一的平衡点，并提供更灵活的比例控制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的四元数姿态控制方法存在两个主要问题：1）不能保证闭环系统存在唯一的平衡姿态误差四元数；2）当姿态误差欧拉轴旋转角度超过π弧度时，比例控制效果会随着系统状态远离稳定平衡点而减弱。

Method: 提出了一种新的姿态控制律，更有效地利用姿态误差欧拉轴-角信息，通过构建严格的Lyapunov函数来证明闭环旋转系统的唯一平衡点具有一致渐近稳定性。

Result: 通过数值仿真和数十次实时翻滚恢复机动飞行测试，证明所提出的轴-角方法在稳定时间方面优于高性能四元数控制器。

Conclusion: 基于欧拉轴-角的方法能够保证闭环系统存在唯一的平衡点，并提供更好的控制性能，特别是在姿态误差较大时的控制效果显著优于传统四元数方法。

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

Conclusion: 该工作为协作操作控制框架奠定了理论基础，几何基元自然地将零空间结构嵌入控制器，可用于引入次级控制目标，为未来应用提供了方向。

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

Conclusion: DARTS展示了更灵活、集成的实时交通事件检测系统的潜力，可支持更快的应急响应和主动交通控制，减少拥堵和二次事故风险，在偏远地区和资源受限环境中具有可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen

overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

### [107] [Kinodynamic Task and Motion Planning using VLM-guided and Interleaved Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26139)
*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合状态树的动力学TAMP框架，将任务和运动决策统一表示，通过运动规划器和物理模拟器验证动力学约束，使用视觉语言模型引导搜索，在模拟和真实环境中显著提高了成功率和规划效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TAMP方法在长时域问题中由于过度运动采样而成本高昂，而LLM虽然提供常识先验但缺乏3D空间推理能力，无法确保几何或动力学可行性。

Method: 基于混合状态树统一表示符号和数值状态，使任务和运动决策能够联合决定；嵌入TAMP问题中的动力学约束通过现成的运动规划器和物理模拟器验证；使用VLM基于状态的可视化渲染引导TAMP解决方案的探索和回溯搜索。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界实验中，相比传统和基于LLM的TAMP规划器，平均成功率提高了32.14%-1166.67%，在复杂问题上减少了规划时间，消融实验进一步突出了VLM引导的益处。

Conclusion: 所提出的动力学TAMP框架通过混合状态表示和VLM引导，有效解决了长时域规划中的效率和可行性问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出自适应轨迹优化算法，通过路径段级安全测试和姿态级安全修正，解决移动机器人在狭窄通道环境中的轨迹规划问题，显著提高成功率和规划速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在狭窄通道环境中经常失败或生成次优路径，需要解决移动机器人在杂乱环境中的轨迹规划挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）路径段级保守碰撞测试，递归细分风险路径段消除碰撞风险；2）姿态级安全修正，基于穿透方向和线搜索确保每个姿态无碰撞且远离障碍物。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比最先进方法，成功率提高1.69倍，规划时间加快3.79倍；真实实验验证机器人能安全通过狭窄通道并保持快速规划性能。

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效解决狭窄通道环境中的轨迹规划问题，显著提升规划成功率和效率。

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和Vision Transformer的新方法，用于在存在动态障碍物的情况下实现基于单目摄像头的3D地图自定位，相比现有最佳方法显著提高了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于单目摄像头的3D地图自定位是实现自动驾驶的关键需求。传统CNN方法在提取局部特征方面表现良好，但在存在动态障碍物（如行人）时效果不佳，因此需要结合能够提取全局特征的Vision Transformer。

Method: 提出了一种结合CNN和Vision Transformer的新方法。CNN擅长提取基于邻近像素的局部特征，而Vision Transformer擅长提取整个图像上补丁间关系的全局特征。

Result: 实验结果显示：在包含动态障碍物的CG数据集上，精度提升率比没有动态障碍物时高1.5倍；在公共数据集上，自定位误差比现有最佳方法小20.1%；使用该方法的机器人平均自定位误差为7.51cm，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 结合CNN和Vision Transformer的方法能够有效应对动态障碍物的挑战，显著提高了基于单目摄像头的3D自定位精度，为自动驾驶应用提供了更可靠的定位解决方案。

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动模仿方法依赖稀缺昂贵的动作捕捉数据集，而基于互联网视频的方法存在物理伪影问题，限制了可扩展性和多样性。

Method: 通过数据精心筛选和物理约束重定向技术，强制执行关节限制、确保地面接触、消除脚部滑动，生成大规模且物理可靠的运动数据。

Result: 在未见运动模仿和骨盆引导路径跟随两种条件下，PHUMA训练的策略均优于Humanoid-X和AMASS，在多样化运动模仿方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PHUMA通过物理约束的数据处理方法，成功解决了基于视频的运动数据中的物理伪影问题，为人形机器人运动模仿提供了高质量的大规模数据集。

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Thor是一个用于人形机器人在接触丰富环境中实现类人全身反应的控制框架，通过力自适应躯干倾斜奖励函数和解耦的强化学习架构，在Unitree G1机器人上显著提升了力交互性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人在服务、工业和救援应用中需要保持全身稳定性的同时进行强烈的环境接触交互，但目前让机器人产生类人的自适应响应仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 基于机器人受力分析设计力自适应躯干倾斜奖励函数，并采用解耦的强化学习架构将上体、腰部和下体分开控制，各组件共享全局观测并联合更新参数。

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上部署Thor后，向后移动时峰值拉力达到167.7N（约G1体重的48%），向前移动时达到145.5N，相比最佳基线分别提升68.9%和74.7%。机器人还能拉动130N负载的货架和单手打开60N的防火门。

Conclusion: Thor框架有效增强了人形机器人的力交互能力，在接触丰富的环境中实现了类人的自适应响应。

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM是一个视觉-LiDAR SLAM框架，结合直接LiDAR里程计和闭环检测与多相机3D高斯泼溅渲染，用于果园环境下的实时3D场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园环境中的自主机器人需要实时3D场景理解，但面临重复行几何、季节性外观变化和风驱动树叶运动等挑战。

Method: 通过批量栅格化互补视角恢复遮挡下的果园结构，使用统一梯度驱动的地图生命周期在关键帧之间保留精细细节并限制内存，通过概率LiDAR深度一致性项指导位姿优化。

Result: 在苹果和梨园中跨休眠期、开花期和收获期部署，相比现有3DGS-SLAM基线提供更清晰、更稳定的重建和更平稳的轨迹，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于果园监测，还可应用于其他需要鲁棒多模态感知的户外领域。

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

TL;DR: Hi-ORS是一种简单有效的后训练方法，通过拒绝采样实现训练稳定性和高鲁棒性，在1.5小时真实世界训练中显著优于强化学习和模仿学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作策略中应用广泛，但视觉-语言-动作模型的微调不稳定，存在价值估计不准确和中间步骤监督稀疏的问题；而模仿学习容易训练但性能较差。

Method: Hi-ORS通过拒绝采样过滤负奖励样本来稳定价值估计，采用奖励加权的监督训练目标提供密集中间步骤监督，并开发异步推理-训练框架支持在线人机交互校正。

Result: 在三个真实世界任务和两个实现中，Hi-ORS仅用1.5小时真实世界训练就使pi-base策略掌握接触丰富的操作，在效果和效率上大幅超越RL和IL基线方法。

Conclusion: 微调后的策略表现出强大的测试时扩展性，能够可靠执行复杂的错误恢复行为以获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限的个体记忆，无法实现长期学习、扩展到异构团队或从故障中恢复，需要统一的记忆表示。

Method: 引入STEM记忆，整合空间场景几何、时间事件历史和具身配置文件，采用大脑-小脑框架，高层大脑进行全局规划，低层控制器本地执行。

Conclusion: RoboOS-NeXT通过记忆中心设计有效实现了终身、可扩展和鲁棒的多机器人协作。

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

Motivation: 传统机器人对自身运动学理解有限，局限于预设任务，无法有效利用工具。需要解决工具使用的四个关键要素：理解期望结果、选择合适工具、确定最佳工具方向、执行精确操作。

Method: 扩展机器人逆运动学求解器，集成仿真学习的动作轨迹与工具，使机器人能够获取使用不同长度工具的顺序动作技能。

Result: 扩展逆运动学求解器误差小于1厘米；训练策略在仿真中平均误差为8厘米；使用两种不同长度工具时性能几乎无差异。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在工具使用四个基本方面探索的潜在进展，使机器人能够掌握跨不同任务的复杂工具操作技能。

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

Result: 在ROS + Gazebo环境中使用PathBench指标评估，相比单一算法基准和基于规则的规划器，在动态和部分可观测环境中表现出更高的成功率、更好的样本效率，对未见障碍物配置具有更好的泛化能力，控制变化更平滑。

Conclusion: 层次化DQN-TD3框架有效结合了离散决策和连续控制的优势，在复杂环境中实现了鲁棒的路径规划与控制性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LFI方法假设固定的支持集，但错误设定的支持集会导致次优且错误自信的后验分布。本文旨在解决这一支持集错误设定问题。

Method: 提出了三种启发式LFI变体：EDGE、MODE和CENTRE，每种方法以不同方式解释后验模式在推理步骤中的偏移，并在LFI步骤中自适应调整支持集。

Result: 在随机动态基准测试中验证了启发式方法的有效性；在DLO操作任务中，推理结果实现了更精细的长度和刚度分类；使用得到的后验作为领域分布进行基于仿真的策略学习，获得了更鲁棒的对象中心智能体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的启发式支持集自适应方法能够有效解决支持集错误设定问题，提高参数推理和策略学习的效果，特别是在动态可变形物体操作任务中表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，HCP仅需25步SDE加一次跳跃即可接近80步DDPM教师模型的准确性和模式覆盖度，同时显著降低延迟。

Conclusion: 多模态行为不需要慢速推理，切换时间将模式保留与速度解耦，为机器人策略提供了实用的精度效率权衡方案。

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

TL;DR: HiMAE是一个分层掩码自编码器框架，通过多分辨率嵌入学习可穿戴传感器数据的表征，将时间分辨率从超参数转变为可解释性探针，在保持高效性的同时优于现有基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器产生丰富的生理时间序列数据，但其预测效用的基本原则尚不明确。作者假设时间分辨率是表征学习的基本轴，不同临床和行为结果依赖于不同时间尺度的结构。

Method: 引入HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），这是一个结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器的自监督框架，生成多分辨率嵌入，能够系统评估哪些时间尺度携带预测信号。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于那些压缩尺度的最先进基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级。HiMAE足够紧凑，可以在手表上完全运行，在智能手表级CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是一种高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维链监督对transformer模型学习动态的影响，发现在符号推理任务中，思维链能加速泛化但不能克服高算法复杂度任务，并揭示了训练过程中推理轨迹与答案一致性的动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链监督能显著提升transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循和受益于思维链的机制仍不清楚。本文旨在通过可控的实验设置来理解这些学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练transformer，通过调节算法复杂度和数据组成来研究泛化。设置两种训练方式：仅输出最终答案和输出思维链轨迹后再回答。使用三参数逻辑曲线对学习过程进行建模。

Result: 思维链通常能提升任务性能，但其效果取决于任务复杂度；发现了瞬态轨迹不忠实阶段：训练早期模型常产生正确答案但跳过或矛盾思维链步骤，后期才对齐；思维链改变transformer内部计算机制。

Conclusion: 思维链加速泛化但不能克服高算法复杂度任务；提出了理解transformer学习的动力学建模框架；将轨迹忠实性表征为训练过程中出现的动态属性；思维链机制性地改变transformer内部计算。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在无线异构场景下的空中联邦学习（OTA-FL），提出了一种允许结构化、时不变模型偏差的SGD更新方法，通过优化偏差-方差权衡来加速收敛并提高泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下受到最弱设备的限制，增加了更新方差，且先前对偏差OTA-FL的分析主要针对凸目标函数，而现代AI模型大多是非凸的。

Method: 开发了新颖的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，允许结构化、时不变模型偏差，同时促进方差减少；提出了非凸联合OTA功率控制设计，并开发了高效的连续凸逼近（SCA）算法。

Result: 推导了有限时间平稳性边界，明确揭示了偏差-方差权衡；在非凸图像分类任务上的实验验证了SCA设计通过优化偏差加速了收敛，并比先前的OTA-FL基线提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的OTA-FL方法在异构无线场景下有效优化了偏差-方差权衡，为非凸目标的联邦学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统在环境条件变化时会出现系统性偏差，导致性能显著下降。现有方法要么忽略这些偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发理论框架将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，引入可学习性比率概念，并提出ABLOC算法迭代学习偏差校正转换并优化组合权重。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中实现了理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性系统收益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投入，为系统设计者提供了何时投资偏差学习与采用更简单方法的定量指导。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决拼车服务中近视决策的局限性，考虑调度决策的长期影响，以降低乘客和运营商成本，减少拥堵和环境影响。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在强化学习机制中嵌入拼车仿真，采用n步时序差分学习从仿真经验中学习时空状态值。

Result: 非近视匹配策略比近视策略服务率提升8.4%，乘客等待时间和车内时间减少；车队规模可减少25%以上；结合再平衡操作后等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提升15.1%。

Conclusion: 仿真强化学习方法能有效实现拼车系统的非近视决策，显著提升服务质量和运营效率，为运营商提供显著成本节约。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态（视觉或语言）的独立编辑，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致在考虑模态间交互和持续知识优化时效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索和双LoRA适配器实现各模态的解耦参数更新，关键组件是受大脑启发的知识连接器，用于选择性激活组合推理并整合不同模态信息。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保留先前编辑内容，为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设立了新基准。

Conclusion: MemEIC成功解决了LVLMs中多模态知识持续编辑的挑战，通过组合编辑方法实现了更好的跨模态知识整合和编辑效果。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Motivation: 传统基于监督微调的冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并影响下游强化学习。

Method: 提出SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行偏好训练学习浅层可转移的表面形式标准；3) 将学习结果传递给带可验证奖励的强化学习进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，该解耦学习框架相比强基线获得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提高4.1%，MathVista提高12.2%。

Conclusion: SPECS有助于减少分布内"卡顿"，改善探索，稳定训练，并提高性能上限，验证了偏好训练在冷启动中的优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个新颖的框架，利用软提示的原像结构来优化黑盒大语言模型的指令，通过共享评分、基于原像的初始化和评分一致性正则化，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍多的评分数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLMs的指令优化面临效率问题，因为白盒LLMs经常将不同的软提示映射到相同的指令，导致冗余查询。传统方法认为这种多对一映射阻碍优化效率，但本文将其重新解释为可加速优化的有用先验知识。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个关键组件：(1) 评分共享：与原像中所有软提示共享评估分数；(2) 基于原像的初始化：使用原像信息选择最大化搜索空间覆盖的初始数据点；(3) 评分一致性正则化：在每个原像内强制执行预测一致性。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明PRESTO具有优越性能，通过利用原像结构，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍多的评分数据，实现更高效的优化。

Conclusion: PRESTO通过重新解释软提示到指令的多对一映射为有用先验知识，开发了一个高效的黑盒LLM指令优化框架，显著提高了优化效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，无需额外训练即可扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，具有良好的兼容性和性能表现。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: 图拓扑方法能有效解决主动学习中的探索-利用权衡问题，在标签稀缺情况下提供更好的性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖于固定的无监督表征，这些表征可能无法捕捉与目标任务相关的重要信息。

Method: 提出了两种学习任务驱动表征的策略：一种是直接学习半监督表征，另一种是基于初始无监督表征进行监督微调。这些表征在主动学习过程中会定期更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，这两种策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表征的方法。

Conclusion: 在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的、可更新的表征能够有效提升在混乱数据池中的性能表现。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种地理基础模型嵌入源在预测马拉维15项常规健康指标方面的表现，发现多源GeoFM集成模型相比传统地理统计方法在87%的指标上表现更好，特别是在人口密度、HIV新病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上预测效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不全的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高数据可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据（2021年1月-2023年5月），比较三种GeoFM嵌入源（Google人口动态基础模型、Google AlphaEarth卫星影像、手机通话记录）与传统地理插值方法的预测性能，采用80/20训练测试分割和5折交叉验证。

Result: 基于嵌入的方法在15个指标中的13个（87%）优于基线地理统计方法。多源GeoFM集成模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、HIV新病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得了较好的R2值（0.63、0.57、0.47）。对于结核病和营养不良等原始数据可用性低的指标预测效果较差。

Conclusion: GeoFM嵌入为LMIC环境下的特定健康和人口指标提供了适度的预测改进，集成多个GeoFM源是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

TL;DR: 本文指出InfoNCE不应被视为有效的互信息估计器，提出了InfoNCE-anchor改进方法用于准确MI估计，并通过评分规则统一了多种对比学习目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE目标虽然广泛用于对比表示学习，但其与互信息的间接联系使其不适合作为有效的MI估计器，需要开发更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当的评分规则将NCE、InfoNCE和f-散度变体统一到单一框架中。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在log评分下实现了最准确的MI估计，但在自监督表示学习中，锚点并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的MI估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束优化问题的微分计算在机器学习、控制和决策系统中越来越重要，但由于求解器专业化和接口不匹配，实际集成仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过区分KKT系统在标准正则性假设下，计算平滑（可能非凸）程序的前向和反向模式解及目标灵敏度。提供基于JuMP的参数中心API，允许用户声明命名参数并直接获取其导数。

Result: 在凸和非凸模型上展示了该框架的能力，包括经济调度、带锥形风险约束的均值-方差投资组合选择和非线性机器人逆运动学。两个配套研究进一步展示了在大规模应用中的影响。

Conclusion: 可微分优化可以作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具部署，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保留对广泛求解器生态系统的访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: INFEX框架解决了线性bandit中探索频率不足的问题，通过在预定时间表上执行探索策略，在其余时间选择贪婪动作，实现了实例依赖的遗憾保证和计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决完全自适应探索方法（如UCB和Thompson Sampling）需要持续探索与纯贪婪方法需要严格多样性假设之间的差距，在安全关键或成本高昂的领域中实现实用且高效的探索策略。

Method: 提出INFEX框架，按照给定时间表执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作，支持无缝集成任何完全自适应探索方法。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相当的实例依赖遗憾。实证评估显示最先进的遗憾性能和运行时间改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的框架，通过限制密集探索计算到不频繁的间隔，在保持理论保证的同时提高了计算效率，具有广泛的适用性和易用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种双专家混合框架用于离散时间生存分析，结合特征编码器MoE和风险MoE，在乳腺癌数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性、个体特征和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活整合这些要素。

Method: 使用双MoE框架：特征编码器MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖性C指数提升高达0.04，与Consurv框架结合时获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双MoE框架能有效提升生存分析性能，灵活集成现有深度学习生存分析流程。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: 提出了三种改进蒸馏去偏能力的方法：开发高质量数据增强、实施迭代知识蒸馏、用教师模型权重初始化学生模型。这是首个大规模研究知识蒸馏对去偏影响及其内部机制的工作。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Motivation: 符号回归旨在从观测数据中发现数学表达式，但深度学习方法的缩放规律尚未被系统探索。受语言建模中缩放定律的启发，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端transformer流水线和精心生成的训练数据，在五个不同模型大小和三个数量级的计算量范围内进行系统实验。

Result: 验证损失和求解率都遵循计算量的幂律趋势；确定了计算最优的超参数缩放：最优批大小和学习率随模型大小增长，最佳token-参数比约为15。

Conclusion: 符号回归性能主要可通过计算量预测，这些发现为训练下一代SR模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

<details>

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中搜索最优参数，限制了模型的表达能力。本文旨在通过动态几何结构优化来提升模型性能，防止过拟合并增强泛化能力。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂性；采用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为"数据驱动几何"概念提供了优雅物理解释；证明即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，通过全面多阶段管道显著提升bug引入提交识别的准确性。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

Result: 开发了包含实际仓库操作的数据集，验证了该方法在真实应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决真实工业环境中的人员识别问题，通过数据驱动的方式实现视觉轨迹与传感器测量的准确匹配。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

TL;DR: 提出LTE方法，通过让LLM学习自己生成的错误答案和过长响应来缓解强化学习中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导，在数学推理任务上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅基于LLM自身生成的响应进行训练，受限于初始能力，容易出现探索停滞问题，无法解决更多训练问题。一些工作尝试使用离策略解决方案但需要专家指导，可用性有限。

Method: 提出LTE方法，通过提示LLM学习其先前自生成的错误答案和过长响应问题，无需任何外部专家指导。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE在Qwen3-4B-Base上平均比GRPO在Pass@1上提升6.38，在Pass@k上提升9.00。进一步分析确认LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练中的利用和探索。

Conclusion: LTE是一种有效的强化学习方法，能够缓解探索停滞问题，提升LLM的推理能力，且无需外部专家指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

TL;DR: maxVSTAR是一个基于WiFi信道状态信息(CSI)的视觉引导模型自适应框架，通过跨模态师生架构实现边缘设备上的自主领域适应，解决环境变化导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi CSI人体活动识别在边缘设备部署时面临领域偏移问题，即环境条件和硬件变化会导致识别性能显著下降，需要一种无需人工干预的自适应解决方案。

Method: 采用跨模态师生架构，使用高精度YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号，为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，从而在边缘端自主微调轻量级CSI活动识别模型STAR。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导适应后，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复到81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR证明了在隐私敏感的物联网环境中进行动态、自监督模型适应的能力，为边缘CSI感知的长期自主活动识别建立了可扩展的实用范例。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

TL;DR: MolBridge是一个基于子结构感知对齐的分子-文本学习框架，通过分子子结构和化学短语的细粒度对齐来增强分子与文本表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: 实验结果表明MolBridge有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，在多个分子基准测试中优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其在增强化学信息理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估先进特征工程和混合模型架构在多元工业时间序列异常检测中的有效性，特别关注蒸汽轮机系统，探索复杂方法是否能在不平衡和时间不确定数据场景下提供更好的检测性能。

Method: 评估了变化点衍生的统计特征、基于聚类的子结构表示和混合学习策略对检测性能的影响，并与基于分段数据的简单随机森林+XGBoost集成模型进行比较。

Result: 复杂方法持续表现不佳，而简单集成模型实现了AUC-ROC 0.976、F1分数0.41，并在定义时间窗口内达到100%的早期检测率。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景下，模型简洁性结合优化分割能超越更复杂的架构，提供更强的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

TL;DR: 提出协作公共资源分配（CPRA）问题，考虑容量约束和时空动态，并开发了基于博弈论的时空强化学习框架GSTRL来解决这一NP难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源，未考虑容量约束，需要更实用的方法来解决现实场景中的协作资源分配问题。

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无间隙，开发GSTRL框架捕捉系统时空动态，近似求解纳什均衡。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，GSTRL框架表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为协作公共资源分配提供了有效的解决方案，具有坚实的理论基础和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过跨训练传播留一扰动并更新累积影响状态，在凸和非凸设置下都提高了影响估计精度，特别是在长训练周期中表现更好，在数据清洗任务中能更可靠地识别噪声样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代以数据为中心的AI需要精确的逐样本影响估计。标准SGD-IE方法通过累加每轮替代项来近似留一影响，但忽略了跨轮次的复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排序。

Method: 提出ACC-SGD-IE，一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。在平滑强凸设置下实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸设置下收紧误差边界；更大的小批量进一步减少常数。

Result: 在Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST数据集上，无论是干净数据还是污染数据，在凸和非凸训练下，ACC-SGD-IE都产生了更准确的影响估计，特别是在长训练周期中。对于下游数据清洗，它能更可靠地标记噪声样本。

Conclusion: 使用ACC-SGD-IE清洗的数据训练的模型性能优于使用SGD-IE清洗的数据训练的模型，证明了该方法在数据影响估计和清洗任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Motivation: 降低可预防的医院再入院率是改善医疗质量和降低成本的国家优先事项，再入院率被用作评估医院医疗质量的基准。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机等机器学习技术分析高维健康索赔数据，采用主成分分析进行降维，并基于AUC指标评估模型性能。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型，能够识别导致再入院的关键因素。

Conclusion: 这些模型可用于识别导致再入院的关键因素，帮助确定需要重点关注的患者，从而降低再入院率、减少成本并提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Motivation: 由于微调大型语言模型需要高昂的计算成本，测试时对齐方法受到关注。

Method: 基于随机控制输入的采样模型预测控制，在预对数（倒数第二层输出）上应用高斯扰动，通过重要性采样获得最优均值。

Result: AISP在使用样本数量方面优于最佳n采样，并比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下优化模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要访问完整原始数据集和模型。本文旨在开发更实用的遗忘解决方案。

Method: 采用归纳方法，将分类训练视为顺序过程，通过反转最后训练序列实现遗忘。在模型末端添加投影-重分布层作为输出过滤器。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100使用CNN模型，Covertype使用树模型）上的实验显示，该方法输出与完全重新训练模型相似，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在实际设置中的适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持输出性能，为机器学习遗忘提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Angular Steering的新方法，通过旋转激活向量在固定二维子空间内实现行为调控，相比现有方法具有更好的灵活性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语言模型行为调控方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响不相关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: Angular Steering方法将行为调控建模为几何旋转，在固定二维子空间内旋转激活向量朝向或远离目标行为方向；还提出了Adaptive Angular Steering变体，仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模的实验中，Angular Steering实现了鲁棒的行为控制，同时保持了通用语言建模性能，相比现有方法展现出更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering为语言模型行为调控提供了一个统一的几何旋转框架，简化了参数选择，提高了模型稳定性，是现有方法的有效泛化。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Motivation: 大多数生成模型缺乏对插值的主要概念，需要限制模型或数据维度的假设，因此需要开发一种无需额外训练的通用插值方案。

Method: 开发了一种针对不同度量和概率分布的插值方案，将插值视为在合适数据分布约束下的测地线，并推导出计算这些曲线的新算法。

Result: 理论上证明该方法在局部可被视为在合适黎曼度量下的测地线；定量实验表明该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更频繁地穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需额外训练的通用插值方案，能够在生成模型中实现受控生成和模型检查，并在高密度区域过渡方面优于基线方法。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Conclusion: IMG算法可视为优化的扩散过程，能够集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能，且多目标玻尔兹曼分布是分布多目标优化问题的最优解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Motivation: 现实世界中的偏好学习涉及具有不同偏好的用户，面临两个主要挑战：识别用户相似性以有效聚合数据，以及处理离线数据不平衡问题。

Method: 提出Off-C²PL算法用于纯离线设置，通过聚类处理多用户偏好；扩展为A²-Off-C²PL算法，在离线聚类基础上主动选择最不具信息性的测试用户偏好维度进行数据增强。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效处理多用户偏好学习中的聚类和数据不平衡问题，主动数据增强策略显著提升了学习效果。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现良好，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，表现为类似词袋匹配器的行为。现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单一向量，忽略了token级别的结构，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负样本失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列结构因果模型的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级别和token级别SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: token粒度分析首次为CLIP的组合脆弱性提供了原则性解释：组合不可识别性。证明了存在伪最优文本编码器，虽然实现了完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负样本。

Conclusion: 分析通过模态间隙将语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败联系起来，展示了迭代组合操作如何增加难度，为改进负样本挖掘策略提供了动机。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无数据的持续学习方法，通过模型反演生成伪数据来避免存储历史数据，解决了隐私和存储限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习需要存储和重放历史数据，但在隐私和安全约束下不可行。无数据持续学习旨在不访问先前数据的情况下更新模型。

Method: 提出分层模型反演（PMI）方法，通过单层优化提供全模型反演的强初始化，大幅减少迭代次数。同时使用高斯分布和对比模型建模类特征，确保合成特征与真实特征对齐。

Result: 该方法能够通过从语义感知投影特征生成伪图像，实现新类的持续学习，在多种持续学习设置中表现出强大的有效性和兼容性。

Conclusion: 结合PMI和特征建模的方法为无数据持续学习提供了高效且有效的解决方案，特别适用于大型预训练模型如CLIP。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

*Sascha Mücke*

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用量子退火训练支持向量机(SVM)的方法，将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，并研究了量子比特数量对预测性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，探索量子比特数量（与对偶权重离散化水平相关）如何影响模型性能，并与经典方法进行比较。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行模型优化，比较不同比特精度编码（如1比特/参数）的性能，并与经典LIBSVM求解器进行对比。

Result: 即使低精度QUBO编码（如1比特/参数）也能产生具有竞争力甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数，但并不总是改善分类性能；选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要。

Conclusion: 尽管当前硬件限制了可求解QUBO问题的规模，但研究结果突显了量子退火在SVM训练中的潜力，随着量子设备的扩展，这种方法有望实现高效的SVM训练。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的方法，在仅需L^4分数误差界的情况下实现多项式时间内的条件采样，解决了传统方法对分数估计误差敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中具有重要应用价值，但近似后验采样在一般情况下是计算不可行的。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要严格的MGF界条件。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，在log-concave分布假设下，仅需L^4分数误差界即可实现条件采样。

Result: 该方法在多项式时间内实现了条件采样，相比传统Langevin动力学方法对分数估计误差的容忍度更高（从MGF界放宽到L^4界）。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学的结合为条件采样提供了更实用的解决方案，降低了对分数估计精度的要求，扩展了后验采样的应用范围。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Motivation: 现有的因果发现方法虽然可以强制执行结构约束，但仍可能产生错误的因果结论。为了完善因果模型并改进下游任务，需要结合因果知识和机制。

Method: 提出干预约束概念，为线性因果模型量化总因果效应的度量，将问题表述为约束优化任务，并使用两阶段约束优化方法求解。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估表明，整合干预约束不仅提高了模型准确性，确保与已有发现的一致性，还促进了原本难以识别的新因果关系的发现。

Conclusion: 干预约束填补了现有方法的空白，通过显式约束变量对之间的总因果效应，使学习模型能够尊重已知的因果影响，提高了模型的解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

Motivation: 平流层突然增温事件是次季节可预测性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在限制。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预测范式，展示了生成AI在加深对大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的高效LLM适配提供了一个实用解决方案，成功解决了推测解码在强化学习训练中的集成问题。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备的连续ECG监测对早期心血管疾病检测具有重要价值，但在资源受限环境中部署深度学习模型面临可靠性挑战，特别是分布外(OOD)数据会导致错误的高置信度预测，危及患者安全。现有OOD检测方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别问题。

Conclusion: 优化的无监督异常检测过滤器可以保护自动化ECG分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更加安全可靠。Deep SVDD被证明是实现这一目标的有效方法。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Method: 将每个数据集转换为可解释元数据，使用两种提示策略：(1)零样本模式依赖预训练知识，(2)元信息模式用历史任务中模型性能示例增强，在合成和真实世界基准上进行测试。

Result: LLM能够利用数据集元数据推荐竞争性模型和超参数而无需搜索，元信息提示的改进证明了它们在上下文元学习中的能力。

Conclusion: LLM作为轻量级通用助手在模型选择和超参数优化方面展现出有前景的新角色。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

TL;DR: 提出ICPO框架，利用LRMs的上下文学习能力提供专家指导，无需依赖高级模型轨迹，解决了现有RLVR方法探索受限和计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO由于依赖当前策略分布，探索能力有限，轨迹多样性不足。而依赖专家模型的方法计算成本高且模型不易获取。

Method: 提出ICPO框架，包含混合策略GRPO与隐式专家强制，扩展策略分布；专家区域拒绝采样过滤不可靠轨迹；退火专家奖励塑形平衡早期指导与后期自主改进。

Result: ICPO在数学推理基准测试中持续提升强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了几何正则化世界模型（GRWM），通过在潜在表示空间中强制连续观测点保持几何接近性，显著改善了世界模型的长期预测能力。该方法简单易用，无需大幅修改架构，即可在确定性3D环境中实现更稳定和准确的长期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在处理长期预测时表现脆弱且性能下降，主要原因是表示质量不足：高维的外部感知输入和损失或纠缠的潜在表示使得动态学习变得困难。作者希望探索仅通过改进表示学习是否能显著提升世界模型性能。

Method: 提出几何正则化世界模型（GRWM），该方法强制要求自然感知轨迹上的连续点在潜在表示空间中保持几何接近性。这种方法简单易用，只需最小架构修改，与多种潜在生成主干兼容，并能随轨迹长度扩展。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，能够在无需扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多基础推测解码框架，通过理论分析证明了多模型推测解码系统的最优推理时间，并实现了3.31-4.43倍的加速效果，同时保持原始输出分布不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理延迟是大规模部署大语言模型的关键瓶颈。现有的推测解码方法通常依赖双基础框架且缺乏严格的理论基础，需要更通用和理论支撑的解决方案。

Method: 提出多基础推测解码框架，通过理论分析多模型token生成的交互关系，优化模型能力、接受长度和计算成本之间的平衡，支持独立实现和与现有技术集成。

Result: 在多个模型系列上的实验结果表明：LLaMA2-Chat 7B加速3.31-4.01倍，LLaMA3-8B加速3.87倍，Vicuna-7B加速4.43倍，Qwen2-7B加速3.85倍，同时保持原始输出分布。

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架在理论上提供了最优推理时间的特征描述，在实践中实现了显著的加速效果，为推测解码技术提供了更通用的范式。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 论文对比了序列建模中参数化内存的关联视图与几何视图，发现Transformer模型会自发形成几何结构来编码全局实体关系，而非仅存储训练时的局部共现关系。这种几何结构简化了复杂推理任务，且其形成源于谱偏差而非架构或优化压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是挑战序列建模中参数化内存的传统关联视图（即仅存储实体间的局部共现关系），探索内存如何形成几何结构来编码全局实体关系，包括非共现实体之间的关系。

Method: 通过分离一个可分析的Transformer推理实例，证明其推理能力无法用纯局部共现存储解释；分析神经嵌入几何的基本特性；通过连接Node2Vec模型，证明几何结构源于自然产生的谱偏差。

Result: 发现Transformer模型确实形成了几何结构来编码全局实体关系，这种几何结构将复杂的ℓ重组合推理任务简化为易于学习的一步几何任务；证明几何结构的形成并非源于架构或优化压力，而是自然产生的谱偏差。

Conclusion: 参数化内存的几何视图应取代传统的关联视图，这为知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的研究提供了新的直觉基础，并指出了使Transformer内存更具几何性的改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 先前工作通过几何设置中的渐近一致性分析建立了HOHL的适定性和不适定性，本文旨在扩展这一理论基础并验证HOHL在更广泛学习场景中的有效性。

Method: 采用截断版本的HOHL方法，通过多尺度拉普拉斯算子诱导的超图结构来强制执行高阶平滑性，并在完全监督学习框架下作为正则化器使用。

Result: 证明了截断HOHL的一致性，推导了显式收敛率，并在主动学习和非几何结构数据集中展示了强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: HOHL在不同学习设置中表现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为超图学习提供了坚实的理论基础和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型的强化学习微调中，使用BF16精度会导致训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配，而简单地改用FP16精度可以有效解决这个问题，带来更稳定的优化、更快的收敛和更强的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调大型语言模型时经常出现不稳定性问题，现有方法通过算法修正或工程对齐来缓解，但本文发现根本原因在于浮点精度本身。BF16虽然动态范围大，但引入的舍入误差破坏了训练和推理之间的一致性。

Method: 将精度从BF16改为FP16，这是一个简单的改变，完全由现代框架支持，只需几行代码修改，无需改变模型架构或学习算法。

Result: 使用FP16能够产生更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在不同任务、算法和框架中都表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16精度在RL微调中比BF16更有效，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 该压缩方案为IoT应用开辟了广阔前景，包括远程监控、边缘分析和在隔离或功率受限环境中的实时决策。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合伯恩斯坦基参数化和Wasserstein距离最小化的新方法，用于分布回归问题，克服了现有方法忽略概率空间几何结构或计算成本高的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布回归方法往往忽略概率空间的几何结构或计算成本高昂，需要一种既能考虑分布几何特性又计算实用的方法。

Method: 使用伯恩斯坦基参数化概率轨迹，将条件分布建模为由高斯分量加权和构成的平滑概率轨迹，均值和协方差作为输入变量的函数，损失函数为预测高斯分布与经验数据之间的平均平方Wasserstein距离。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上实验表明，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上具有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下，轨迹平滑度优于或与替代方法相当，对数据结构变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了几何精度、计算实用性和可解释性的平衡解决方案，未来研究方向包括扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算以及适应高维数据。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Conclusion: 提出的私有秩r近似算法在多个场景下优于现有技术，特别是在稠密设置中达到了非私有算法的最优性能，并探索了一致性在图问题中的应用。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编码和摘要任务实验表明，LoRAQuant使用显著更低的比特数，但实现了可比甚至更高的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant能够有效降低多适配器场景下的聚合成本，在显著减少比特使用的同时保持或提升模型性能，为大规模LoRA应用提供了高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

*Giulia DeSalvo,Clara Mohri,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出预算化延迟框架，旨在训练有效的延迟算法同时最小化训练期间的专家查询成本，通过选择性查询专家子集来平衡成本与预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需要为每个训练实例查询所有专家，这在专家查询成本高昂时变得不可行，违背了延迟的核心目标——限制不必要的专家使用。

Method: 提出新的两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟算法，选择性查询专家子集；建立理论保证包括泛化边界和标签复杂度分析。

Result: 在多个领域的实证结果表明，算法显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测准确性。

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能够在保持性能的同时有效控制训练成本。

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Top-K压缩器，通过轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现无需索引的All-Reduce操作，在保持Top-K性能的同时显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈问题，现有梯度压缩方法存在局限性：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且性能不佳，Top-K保留信息但失去压缩特性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐跨节点稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)算法。

Result: ARC-Top-K在理论上具有压缩性，结合EF21M实现线性加速和更快的收敛速度；实验上匹配Top-K精度同时减少高达60.7%的训练时间。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，有效缓解分布式机器学习通信瓶颈。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出机器学习遗忘（MU）算法评估中存在的问题：仅从同一训练模型出发多次运行MU算法可能产生非代表性结果，因为MU方法对模型训练时的随机数种子选择高度敏感。建议在MU算法比较中应考虑不同模型训练种子的变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数实用的MU算法都是近似方法，其性能只能通过实证评估。常见的做法是从同一训练模型多次独立运行MU算法，但这种做法可能产生非代表性结果，因为MU方法对模型训练时的随机数种子选择高度敏感。

Method: 通过分析MU算法评估实践，指出仅从同一训练模型出发多次运行MU算法的问题，并建议在实证比较中考虑不同模型训练种子的变异性。

Result: 研究发现，即使对于相同的架构和数据集，某些MU方法对模型训练时的随机数种子选择高度敏感，导致仅从同一训练模型出发的多次运行结果可能不具有代表性。

Conclusion: 建议在MU算法的实证比较中，不仅要考虑从同一训练模型多次运行的结果，还应反映不同模型训练种子带来的变异性，以获得更准确的性能评估。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在协方差矩阵的差分隐私发布中，对于不同范数误差和数据集规模的最优性存在局限，需要一种更通用的最优机制

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于大数据集直接应用，对于小数据集通过投影到核范数球来优化误差

Result: 对于大数据集(n≥d²/ε)，在所有p-Schatten范数下达到最优误差；对于小数据集(n<d²/ε)，通过投影达到最优Frobenius范数误差O(√(dTr(Σ)/n))

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下实现谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集规模下都能达到信息理论最优误差界

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaMP量化是一种新颖的序列维度线性变换方法，通过在序列维度应用变换并保持少量高精度token，显著改善了低比特激活量化的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是减少生成式AI模型推理延迟、功耗和内存占用的关键方法，但当激活量化到8比特以下时，准确性会急剧下降。现有研究表明可逆线性变换（如旋转）可以通过重新参数化特征通道和权重来辅助量化。

Method: 提出STaMP量化策略，在序列维度应用线性变换以利用语言和视觉数据中的强局部相关性，同时在每个中间激活中保持少量token为更高精度。

Result: 在最近的LVM和LLM架构上评估STaMP，证明其显著改善了低比特宽度激活量化，并与现有的激活和权重量化方法（包括最近的特征变换）互补。

Conclusion: STaMP量化通过序列维度变换和混合精度策略，有效解决了低比特激活量化时的精度下降问题，为生成式AI模型的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 影响函数(IFs)需要计算整个数据集的Hessian矩阵，这在计算资源上非常昂贵。传统的随机采样方法由于样本配置的高方差导致IF估计高度不一致，因此需要更有效的采样策略。

Method: 提出了两种基于特征和logits的采样器，通过考虑特征或logits的随机分布来选择小型但具有代表性的数据子集，从而提高IF估计的准确性。

Result: 在类别移除实验中，该方法相比基线减少了30.1%的计算时间和42.2%的内存使用，或者将F1分数提高了2.5%。

Conclusion: 基于特征和logits的采样技术能够有效提高影响函数估计的效率和准确性，为黑盒模型训练数据影响分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 当前时序基础模型研究主要关注预测任务，不清楚其学习到的表示是否具有通用性，本研究旨在探索冻结的预训练预测模型是否能提供有效的分类表示。

Method: 比较不同的表示提取策略，并引入两种模型无关的嵌入增强方法。

Result: 最佳预测模型实现的分类准确率与专门为分类预训练的SOTA模型相当甚至更好，且观察到预测性能与分类性能之间存在正相关关系。

Conclusion: 学习预测可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有效途径，挑战了任务特定预训练的必要性假设。

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数（厘兵分），这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种能够解释引擎评估背后具体棋子贡献的方法。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算SHAP值，为每个棋子提供加性贡献度，确保局部忠实性和人类可解释性。

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估分解为单个棋子贡献的方法，该方法受到古典象棋教学法的启发，并基于现代可解释AI技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新可能性，并发布了配套代码和数据以促进可解释象棋AI的未来研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)建立了生存压力与信息处理需求之间的进化联系，压缩效率原则(CEP)说明高效压缩如何通过异常累积机制选择生成性因果模型，使现实对齐成为必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认同压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这一过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入两层次分析框架：信息论必要性(ITI)从进化角度解释生存压力如何导致信息处理需求；压缩效率原则(CEP)从机械角度说明高效压缩如何通过异常累积动态选择因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化能力相关；异常累积率可区分因果模型和相关模型；分层系统在不同抽象层表现出递增效率；生物系统的代谢成本与表征复杂度相关。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统中的智能收敛提供了统一解释，解决了智能的认识论和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Conclusion: 该框架为建模多样化、基于角色的偏好提供了一种有效方法，能够更好地对齐LLM评判者与人类偏好。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的模型在FACTS Grounding公共子集上达到与GPT-4o相当的性能（在±5%等效范围内），同时云定价比GPT-4o低约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持与大型模型相当性能的同时大幅降低推理成本。

Method: 结合最小化定向"外骨骼推理"支架与行为微调，教导协议遵从性而非领域答案，两者协同作用显著提升性能。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，GPT-4o得分73.5%，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，配对差异0.8个百分点，在±5%范围内建立等效性。推理成本比GPT-4o低约19倍。

Conclusion: 通过定向推理和行为微调的协同方法，小型语言模型可以在特定任务上达到与大型模型相当的性能，同时大幅降低成本，为成本高效的AI部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划能够有效估计认知偏见，为理解人类行为中的系统性偏差提供了新途径。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with

### [200] [From Queries to Insights: Agentic LLM Pipelines for Spatio-Temporal Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25997)
*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于智能体管道的自然语言到SQL系统，通过ReAct智能体协调规划、分解和调整查询，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自然语言到SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与特定模式类别的对齐、时间推理和选择适当输出等问题。

Method: 扩展了基于llama-3-sqlcoder-8b的文本到SQL基线，通过Mistral-based ReAct智能体进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询评估中，智能体管道相比基线系统准确率大幅提升（91.4% vs. 28.6%），并通过地图、图表和结构化自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 智能体编排而非仅依赖更强的SQL生成器，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景基础，能够支持缺乏SQL专业知识、详细模式知识或提示技能的用户。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文献的快速增长，特别是在大语言模型领域，使得撰写全面且最新的调研论文变得越来越困难。

Method: 采用多阶段流水线，包括检索增强合成、并行章节生成、迭代优化和实时文献检索，并使用多LLM评估框架来评估质量。

Result: 实验结果显示autosurvey2持续优于现有基于检索和自动化的基线方法，在结构连贯性和主题相关性方面获得更高分数，同时保持强引用保真度。

Conclusion: 通过将检索、推理和自动评估整合到统一框架中，autosurvey2为生成长篇学术调研提供了可扩展且可复现的解决方案，并为自动化学术写作的未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

### [202] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，能够在车辆陷入困境时通过自主推理或乘客引导来解决问题，无需修改现有系统架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在某些复杂交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和人工接管方案存在成本高、效率低、限制可访问性等问题。

Method: 开发了StuckSolver作为插件模块，利用LLM分析传感器数据检测困境状态，理解环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复指令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最先进的性能，结合乘客引导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够增强自动驾驶车辆在复杂场景中的恢复能力，提高整体交通流畅性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI问责制的重要性，指出当前AI缺乏问责机制的问题，并提出了实现AI问责的方法框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速提升，需要确保AI能够为消费者、选民和决策者服务，因此必须建立有效的问责机制。当前AI往往无法被质疑、讨论或制裁，存在问责缺失的问题。

Method: 将一般问责定义应用于AI领域，阐述AI问责的具体含义，探索提高AI问责性的方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责的三个关键要素：信息请求、讨论机制和制裁能力，揭示了当前AI问责机制的不足。

Conclusion: 需要建立完善的AI问责框架，确保所有受AI影响的个体都能对AI进行有效问责，实现AI的负责任发展。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为大学物理问题建立形式化推理基准，填补Lean4中物理基准测试的空白，评估现有模型在物理推理方面的能力。

Method: 构建包含200个手工制作和同行评审的物理问题基准测试LeanPhysBench，开发社区驱动的物理定理库PhysLib，使用主流数学证明器和最先进闭源模型进行基准测试。

Result: 最佳模型DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B仅达到16%准确率，Claude-Sonnet-4达到35%，PhysLib平均提升模型性能11.75%。

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何利用AI提升人类监督质量，重点关注AI输出的事实验证问题。研究发现结合AI和人类评分优于单独使用任一方法，AI助手能提高人类准确性，但显示AI解释、置信度和标签会导致过度依赖，而仅显示搜索结果和证据能培养更适当的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全性变得日益困难，需要探索如何利用AI改进人类监督质量，特别是针对人类已难以处理的事实验证安全问题。

Method: 研究AI评分与人类评分的结合方式，测试不同类型的AI助手对人类事实验证准确性的影响，包括显示AI解释、置信度、标签与仅显示搜索结果和证据的对比。

Result: 结合AI和人类评分优于单独使用任一方法；AI助手能提高人类准确性；显示AI解释、置信度和标签会导致过度依赖，而仅显示搜索结果和证据能培养更适当的信任。

Conclusion: 这些结果对放大监督——即结合人类和AI来监督超越人类专家性能的AI系统——具有重要意义，表明适当的AI辅助方式能有效提升人类监督质量。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素，需要建立经济分析框架来指导模型部署决策。

Method: 采用定量经济学框架，将LLM推理过程视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，基于WiNEval-3.0的实证数据构建LLM推理生产前沿。

Result: 揭示了三个原则：边际成本递减、规模收益递减以及最优成本效益区域，为模型部署提供了经济基础。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济依据，还为未来基于市场的AI推理资源定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法，先在数学领域通过强化学习培养推理能力，然后在多领域联合强化学习中迁移和巩固这些能力，无需专用奖励模型即可提升大语言模型的通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏对其他领域推理能力的系统培养。作者希望开发一种简单通用的方法，能够在大语言模型中系统地培养跨领域的推理能力。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：第一阶段在数学领域进行强化学习，使用可验证的奖励来培养基础推理技能；第二阶段在多领域混合数据上进行联合强化学习，迁移和巩固推理能力。该方法骨干模型无关，仅需标准可验证性检查。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上的多领域评估显示，该方法带来了一致的性能提升。消融实验表明两个阶段都是必要的，数学优先的推理激发增加了解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力培养方案，能够有效提升大语言模型在多个领域的推理表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Method: 结合LLM推理和大规模进化搜索，包含冷启动初始化、进化采样策略、领域特定评估器和分布式异步执行基础设施。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进结果：ALE-Bench 1976.3(+5.2%)、MLE-Bench 43.56%(+4.0pp)、KernelBench最高20倍加速，并在经典数学问题上建立新SOTA。

Conclusion: FM Agent在企业和基础科学研究中具有广泛应用前景，能够加速创新、自动化复杂发现过程，带来显著的工程和科学进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

TL;DR: 提出了QASU基准，用于评估大语言模型处理问卷数据的结构化能力，通过测试不同序列化格式和提示策略，发现优化格式和提示组合能显著提升模型在问卷分析任务中的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前问卷数据规模庞大且结构复杂，但大语言模型处理这类结构化数据的能力尚未充分探索，现有调查分析工具缺乏与LLM的有效集成，导致研究人员和用户缺乏基于证据的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准，测试六种结构化技能（包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理），在六种序列化格式和多种提示策略下进行实验，系统分离格式和提示效果。

Result: 实验表明，选择有效的格式和提示组合相比次优格式可提高准确率高达8.8个百分点；对于特定任务，通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可平均再提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准为基于LLM的问卷分析研究提供了简单而通用的基础，通过系统隔离格式和提示效应，推动该领域的研究和实际应用发展。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于群体的强化学习在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中存在的结构盲问题，包括探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视等挑战。

Method: 动态构建状态转移图，利用图论中心性提供三个协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健、可泛化策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IPA-UCT的新技术，通过弱化状态抽象条件来提高MCTS的采样效率，在多种测试领域和迭代预算下优于现有的OGA-UCT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的状态-动作对抽象方法（如OGA-UCT）在噪声或大动作空间设置中难以找到状态抽象，限制了MCTS的采样效率提升。

Method: 提出了IPA-UCT技术，使用较弱的理想剪枝抽象（IPA）条件，在精度损失较小的情况下找到更多抽象，并建立了IPA和ASAP作为更通用p-ASAP框架特例的理论框架。

Result: IPA-UCT在广泛的测试领域和迭代预算下实验验证优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件有效解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，为MCTS提供了更高效的抽象方法，并建立了统一的抽象理论框架。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调中贝叶斯在线任务选择的统一框架，通过自适应维护任务难度的后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，显著提高数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率低下、成本高、适应性差等问题，需要一种更智能的任务选择策略来优化训练过程。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断框架，自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合直接评估的显式证据和从评估中推断未选择任务的隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，采用超轻量插值插件估计未评估任务难度。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模的LLM上，BOTS相比基线方法和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效提升强化微调的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于项目认知需求的数据选择方法Scales++，用于创建高效的小型基准测试子集，显著降低评估成本同时保持预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准测试子集选择方法存在高昂的前期成本、无法处理新基准测试的冷启动问题，以及假设未来模型与现有模型有相似失败模式的脆弱性。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法，基于任务项目的内在属性而非模型特定失败模式进行选择，通过Scales++方法根据基准样本的认知需求进行数据选择。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低超过18倍，在仅使用0.5%数据子集的情况下，在Open LLM Leaderboard上预测完整基准测试分数的平均绝对误差为2.9%。

Conclusion: 项目中心方法能够在不显著降低保真度的情况下实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个AI驱动的编程作业评分系统，通过微调大语言模型生成教学对齐的自动反馈，并使用对比学习代码嵌入进行语义聚类可视化，将传统总结性评分转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分系统只能提供通过/失败结果，缺乏对学生思维和学习需求的洞察。编程教育的快速发展超出了传统评估工具的能力，教师难以提供有意义且可扩展的反馈。

Method: 系统采用微调的大语言模型生成自动反馈，使用对比学习代码嵌入进行可视化聚类，支持提示池模板指导反馈风格。模型基于精心策划的学生代码和专家反馈进行微调。

Result: 在600份学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐。基于1000份标注提交训练的代码嵌入能够按功能和方法的相似性将解决方案分组为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: Autograder+通过整合AI驱动反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，在减少教师工作量的同时支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型，本研究旨在弥合高性能医学AI与透明度之间的差距，为临床可靠的表征提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 将医学稀疏自编码器（MedSAEs）应用于MedCLIP（在胸部X光片和报告上训练的视觉语言模型）的潜在空间，并提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和通过MedGEMMA基础模型进行自动神经元命名的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上的实验表明，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征实现了更高的单义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究为临床可靠表征提供了可扩展的步骤，弥合了高性能医学AI与透明度之间的差距。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理过程来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上达到极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算来提高任务性能，先前研究认为这种扩展推理也能通过改进拒绝机制来增强安全性。然而作者发现相反的情况：同样的推理过程可以被用来绕过安全防护。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求与长序列的无害谜题推理过程相结合，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的安全机制。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超先前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，最可解释的推理形式——显式链式思维，在与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在规范推理领域的能力，发现虽然LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中存在不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理中的认知偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务和许可等模态概念，尽管LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过比较LLMs在规范模态和认知模态下的推理表现，引入了一个涵盖广泛形式推理模式的新数据集，并纳入了影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs在规范推理中表现出显著的不一致性，并显示出与人类推理研究中观察到的类似认知偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: 本文提出异步思维（AsyncThink）作为大语言模型推理的新范式，通过将内部思考过程组织为并发可执行结构，实现智能体协作解决复杂问题。该方法通过组织者动态分配子查询、合并中间知识并生成连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设想智能体组织的新时代，通过协作和并发工作解决复杂问题，实现超越个体智能的成果。需要新的推理范式来支持智能体的并发协作。

Method: 提出异步思维协议，包含组织者动态分配子查询给工作者、合并中间知识、生成连贯解决方案。思考结构可通过强化学习进一步优化。

Result: 实验表明，AsyncThink相比并行思维降低28%的推理延迟，同时在数学推理上提高准确性。该方法能够泛化学到的异步思维能力，无需额外训练即可有效处理未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思维是实现智能体组织愿景的有效范式，通过并发思考结构显著提升推理效率和质量，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

### [221] [Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721)
*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于模型内部架构——视觉键向量在注意力空间中与文本键向量分布不一致，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉-语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。与之前归因于数据不平衡或指令调优等外部因素的研究不同，本文认为这种偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用定性（t-SNE）和定量（Jensen-Shannon散度）方法分析其分布结构。

Result: 结果直接证明视觉和文本键在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间。模态间差异在统计上显著，比模态内变异高出几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

TL;DR: 本文对15个基础模型在3种计算平台（HPC超级计算、云平台、大学集群）上进行了跨平台推理能力评估，涵盖79个问题、8个学术领域，挑战了传统规模扩展假设，发现训练数据质量比模型大小更重要。

Motivation: 建立基础设施无关的基准测试，全面评估当代基础模型在不同计算平台上的推理能力，为教育、生产和研究环境中的模型选择提供实用指导。

Method: 采用三阶段实验设计：(1)在MareNostrum 5上建立6个模型的基线；(2)在大学集群和Nebius AI Studio上验证基础设施无关的可重复性；(3)在两个平台上进行79个问题的全面评估，探索架构多样性的泛化能力。

Result: 研究结果挑战了传统的规模扩展假设，确立了训练数据质量比模型大小更关键的重要性，并为不同应用场景提供了模型选择的实用指南。

Conclusion: 三基础设施方法和79问题基准测试能够随着基础模型的发展纵向跟踪推理能力，为模型评估提供了可靠的框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一种最小控制接口，让智能体在自主行动或请求人类干预之间选择，同时人类在信任或监督之间选择。通过将这种交互建模为马尔可夫博弈，在满足特定条件时，智能体增加自主性的决策不会损害人类价值，提供了一种部署后增强模型安全性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体能力不断增强，如何在保持底层系统不变的情况下维持有意义的人类控制成为一个核心安全问题。研究旨在开发一种透明控制层，使智能体学会在风险时请求干预，在安全时自主行动。

Method: 将人机交互建模为两人马尔可夫博弈，特别关注马尔可夫势博弈情况。通过结构假设分析人类价值函数，提供对齐保证。在网格世界模拟中通过独立学习验证方法有效性。

Result: 模拟结果显示，通过独立学习，智能体学会在不确定时请求帮助，人类学会何时进行监督，形成避免安全违规的协作模式。这证明了在部署后使未对齐模型更安全的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种实用的方法，在保持预训练策略和环境奖励结构不变的情况下，通过透明控制层使智能体在部署后变得更安全，实现了特定形式的内在对齐。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，特别是理解它们如何实现通用的过滤操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多样化的列表处理任务上，识别出编码过滤谓词的注意力头，并测试其表示的通用性和可移植性。

Result: 发现少量注意力头编码紧凑的过滤谓词表示，该表示可在不同集合、格式、语言和任务间移植应用。同时识别出另一种策略：急切评估项目是否满足谓词并在项目表示中存储中间结果。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够开发人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

TL;DR: 比较三种AR导航辅助工具（屏幕指南针、屏幕雷达和世界内垂直箭头）在户外搜索任务中的效果，发现所有导航辅助都能提升搜索性能，其中世界内箭头最受用户偏好，但用户对物理环境的注意力降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究头戴式增强现实（AR）作为替代或补充智能手机和手表的持续信息消费范式，比较不同AR导航辅助工具在搜索任务中的效果。

Method: 在户外进行用户研究（n=24），参与者搜索隐藏的虚拟目标物品，分析搜索任务性能、移动、眼动、调查响应和对象回忆。

Result: 所有导航辅助工具相比控制条件都提升了搜索性能，世界内箭头有额外益处且最受用户偏好；用户回忆的物理对象少于虚拟对象，表明对物理环境的注意力减少。

Conclusion: AR导航辅助工具能增强搜索任务性能，但可能导致用户对物理环境的注意力降低，这可能带来不良副作用。

Abstract: Head-worn augmented reality (AR) is a hotly pursued and increasingly feasible
contender paradigm for replacing or complementing smartphones and watches for
continual information consumption. Here, we compare three different AR
navigation aids (on-screen compass, on-screen radar and in-world vertical
arrows) in a wide-area outdoor user study (n=24) where participants search for
hidden virtual target items amongst physical and virtual objects. We analyzed
participants' search task performance, movements, eye-gaze, survey responses
and object recall. There were two key findings. First, all navigational aids
enhanced search performance relative to a control condition, with some benefit
and strongest user preference for in-world arrows. Second, users recalled fewer
physical objects than virtual objects in the environment, suggesting reduced
awareness of the physical environment. Together, these findings suggest that
while navigational aids presented in AR can enhance search task performance,
users may pay less attention to the physical environment, which could have
undesirable side-effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着增强现实成为移动信息消费的主要模式，理解在物理环境中查看虚拟注释时的感知需求对用户效能和安全的影响至关重要，但目前这些影响尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 参与者沿预定路径行走，搜索物理或虚拟物品，体验两种注释密度水平，并在自由行走或强制速度和路径引导条件下进行测试。

Result: 注释密度影响行为表现，降低了对环境中不常见物体的意识；搜索任务表现和事后回忆分析显示对物理和虚拟对象的注意力分配存在差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，为移动使用的AR应用设计提出了相关考虑因素。

Abstract: Augmented reality is projected to be a primary mode of information
consumption on the go, seamlessly integrating virtual content into the physical
world. However, the potential perceptual demands of viewing virtual annotations
while navigating a physical environment could impact user efficacy and safety,
and the implications of these demands are not well understood. Here, we
investigate the impact of virtual path guidance and augmentation density
(visual clutter) on search performance and memory. Participants walked along a
predefined path, searching for physical or virtual items. They experienced two
levels of augmentation density, and either walked freely or with enforced speed
and path guidance. Augmentation density impacted behavior and reduced awareness
of uncommon objects in the environment. Analysis of search task performance and
post-experiment item recall revealed differing attention to physical and
virtual objects. On the basis of these findings we outline considerations for
AR apps designed for use on the go.

Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车有潜力提升盲人和低视力人群的出行能力，但需要了解他们在真实驾驶环境中的具体交互需求。

Method: 进行了6次实地和实验室焦点小组研究，涉及16名参与者，让他们体验真实驾驶条件，并进行主题分析。

Abstract: Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) hold promise for enhancing the mobility of
blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To understand the situated interaction
needs of BLV passengers, we conducted six on-road, and in-lab focus groups with
16 participants, immersing them in real-world driving conditions. Our thematic
analysis reveals that BLV participants express a high initial 'faith' in FAVs,
but require layered, value-sensitive information during the ride to cultivate
trust. The participants' modality preference for voice suggests re-evaluating
the role of haptics for BLV users in FAVs. Our findings show the importance of
a respectful interaction design in FAVs that both address BLV users' mobility
challenges and uphold their dignity. While others have advocated for a dignity
lens, our contribution lies in grounding this framework in empirical findings
and unpacking what it means to design for dignity in the context of FAVs.

Method: 系统使用沉浸式VR程序展示不断变化的分形艺术作品，同时通过EEG接口实时分析用户脑电波数据，并将这些数据映射到VR环境中，自适应地调整视听参数。

Result: 初步反馈表明FractalBrain具有促进正念和增强注意力的潜力。

Conclusion: FractalBrain系统展示了结合分形艺术、VR和EEG技术来辅助正念练习的有效性，为初学者提供了更易进入冥想状态的工具。

Abstract: Mindfulness has been studied and practiced in enhancing psychological
well-being while reducing neuroticism and psychopathological indicators.
However, practicing mindfulness with continuous attention is challenging,
especially for beginners. In the proposed system, FractalBrain, we utilize an
interactive audiovisual fractal with a geometric repetitive pattern that has
been demonstrated to induce meditative effects. FractalBrain presents an
experience combining a surreal virtual reality (VR) program with an
electroencephalogram (EEG) interface. While viewing an ever-changing
fractal-inspired artwork in an immersive environment, the user's EEG stream is
analyzed and mapped into VR. These EEG data adaptively manipulates the
audiovisual parameters in real-time, generating a distinct experience for each
user. The pilot feedback suggests the potential of the FractalBrain to
facilitate mindfulness and enhance attention.

*Leixian Shen,Yifang Wang,Huamin Qu,Xing Xie,Haotian Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了交互增强指令（IAI）模型，这是一个紧凑的实体关系图，用于形式化描述交互和文本提示如何协同增强人类与生成式AI的通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本提示是人类与生成式AI通信的最常见方式，但难以传达细粒度和引用意图。结合精确GUI交互（如刷选和点击）是很有前景的解决方案，但缺乏形式化模型来建模提示与交互之间的协同设计，阻碍了比较和创新。

Method: 通过迭代和演绎过程，开发了IAI模型，这是一个紧凑的实体关系图。从现有工具中提炼出十二个可复现且可组合的原子交互范式，验证了模型在系统化设计表征和比较方面的能力。

Result: 案例研究进一步证明了该模型在应用、精炼和扩展这些范式方面的实用性。从现有工具中成功识别出十二个可复现的原子交互范式。

Conclusion: IAI模型具有描述性、区分性和生成性能力，能够塑造未来的生成式AI系统。这些结果说明了IAI模型在促进系统化设计表征、比较和创新方面的价值。

Abstract: Text prompt is the most common way for human-generative AI (GenAI)
communication. Though convenient, it is challenging to convey fine-grained and
referential intent. One promising solution is to combine text prompts with
precise GUI interactions, like brushing and clicking. However, there lacks a
formal model to model synergistic designs between prompts and interactions,
hindering their comparison and innovation. To fill this gap, via an iterative
and deductive process, we develop the Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI)
model, a compact entity-relation graph formalizing how the combination of
interactions and text prompts enhances human-generative AI communication. With
the model, we distill twelve recurring and composable atomic interaction
paradigms from prior tools, verifying our model's capability to facilitate
systematic design characterization and comparison. Case studies further
demonstrate the model's utility in applying, refining, and extending these
paradigms. These results illustrate our IAI model's descriptive,
discriminative, and generative power for shaping future GenAI systems.

*Navid Ashrafi,Philipp Graf,Manuela Marquardt,Francesco Vona,Julia Schorlemmer,Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究分析了6种不同特征的虚拟化身在患者报告结局测量应用中的交互，发现能力是选择化身的最关键因素，而人类相似度对健康数据披露影响很小。性别无显著影响，但服装风格很重要，专业着装的男性化身因性别刻板印象获得更高能力评分，而专业女性化身在温暖度和吸引力方面评分较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟化身的外观显著影响其感知适当性和用户体验，特别是在医疗保健应用中。本研究旨在调查化身评分与用户偏好之间的相关性，以优化医疗应用中的化身设计。

Method: 47名参与者完成了包含30个PROMIS项目的医疗保健调查，然后从温暖度、能力、吸引力和人类相似度等方面对6个不同特征的化身进行评分，并评估他们分享个人数据的意愿。

Result: 能力是化身选择的最关键因素，人类相似度对健康数据披露影响最小。性别无显著影响，但服装风格起关键作用：专业着装的男性化身因性别刻板印象获得更高能力评分，而专业女性化身在温暖度和吸引力方面评分较低。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在医疗保健应用中精心设计化身的重要性，以提升用户体验和参与度，特别是需要考虑能力感知和服装风格的影响。

Abstract: The appearance of a virtual avatar significantly influences its perceived
appropriateness and the user's experience, particularly in healthcare
applications. This study analyzed interactions with six avatars of varying
characteristics in a patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) application to
investigate correlations between avatar ratings and user preferences.
Forty-seven participants completed a healthcare survey involving 30 PROMIS
items (Global Health and Physical Function) and then rated the avatars on
warmth, competence, attractiveness, and human-likeness, as well as their
willingness to share personal data. The results showed that competence was the
most critical factor in avatar selection, while human-likeness had minimal
impact on health data disclosure. Gender did not significantly affect the
ratings, but clothing style played a key role, with male avatars in
professional attire rated higher in competence due to gender-stereotypical
expectations. In contrast, professional female avatars were rated lower in
warmth and attractiveness. These findings underline the importance of
thoughtful avatar design in healthcare applications to enhance user experience
and engagement.

*Alon Rosenbaum,Yigal David,Eran Kaufman,Gilad Ravid,Amit Ronen,Assaf Krebs*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 开发了一个教练式LLM环境，包含发散思维和聚合思维两种角色，通过实验评估其效果和用户行为。研究发现用户对哪种角色支持创造力的主观感知与客观表现存在差异，个体差异预测了用户对不同角色的使用偏好，交互模式反映了设计思维模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在创造性工作中应用日益广泛，但先前研究表明它们可能削弱无辅助创造力。为了解决这一矛盾，需要开发能够平衡探索和收敛的创造力支持系统。

Method: 开发了包含发散思维和聚合思维两种角色的教练式LLM环境，通过控制实验让参与者与不同角色互动，对照组使用提供直接答案的标准LLM。

Result: 用户对哪种角色支持创造力的主观感知与客观表现存在差异；个体差异能够预测用户对发散思维与聚合思维角色的使用偏好；交互模式反映了设计思维模型。

Conclusion: 提出了基于角色指导和个性化的创造力支持系统设计原则，这些系统通过支架式支持而非取代人类创造力，推进了人机协作工具的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping creative work and
problem-solving; however, prior research suggests that they may diminish
unassisted creativity. To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment
was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two
complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through
a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona,
while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers.
  Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity
often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses
revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent
versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing.
Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model,
demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving.
  Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that
strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based
guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration
tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类与生成式AI互动中自信心的作用，发现用户对自身和AI的信心影响寻求和依赖AI建议的决策，而建议采纳反过来塑造这种信心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI与人类互动中自信心如何影响建议寻求和依赖决策，以及这种互动如何反过来塑造自信心。

Method: 使用文本生成任务，在研究中让参与者制定事件计划，可以选择请求AI建议（研究1）或随机分配接收建议（研究2），然后测量他们对建议的依赖程度。

Result: 寻求AI建议与对AI信心较高、对自身信心较低相关；建议采纳增加对AI的信心，拒绝建议增加对自身的信心；随机分配显示建议暴露会提高对AI和自身的信心。

Conclusion: 自信心在人类与生成式AI互动中起关键作用，既受先前对自身和AI可靠性的信念影响，也受情境依赖的建议暴露影响。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can aid humans in a wide range of
tasks, but its effectiveness critically depends on users being able to evaluate
the accuracy of GenAI outputs and their own expertise. Here we asked how
confidence in self and GenAI contributes to decisions to seek and rely on
advice from GenAI ('prospective confidence'), and how advice-taking in turn
shapes this confidence ('retrospective confidence'). In a novel paradigm
involving text generation, participants formulated plans for events, and could
request advice from a GenAI (Study 1; N=200) or were randomly assigned to
receive advice (Study 2; N=300), which they could rely on or ignore. Advice
requests in Study 1 were related to higher prospective confidence in GenAI and
lower confidence in self. Advice-seekers showed increased retrospective
confidence in GenAI, while those who declined advice showed increased
confidence in self. Random assignment in Study 2 revealed that advice exposure
increases confidence in GenAI and in self, suggesting that GenAI advice-taking
causally boosts retrospective confidence. These results were mirrored in advice
reliance, operationalised as the textual similarity between GenAI advice and
participants' responses, with reliance associated with increased retrospective
confidence in both GenAI and self. Critically, participants who chose to
obtain/rely on advice provided more detailed responses (likely due to the
output's verbosity), but failed to check the output thoroughly, missing key
information. These findings underscore a key role for confidence in
interactions with GenAI, shaped by both prior beliefs about oneself and the
reliability of AI, and context-dependent exposure to advice.

Result: 在公共数据集上推荐系统普遍有所改进，但个体表现存在差异；在隐藏测试集上现有方法在大规模网页推荐方面存在局限性，而LLM集成显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: ORBIT基准测试揭示了现有推荐方法在大规模网页推荐中的局限性，强调了LLM集成的改进潜力，为推荐系统研究提供了统一的评估标准。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT
benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at

TL;DR: 提出ReaKase-8B框架，利用法律事实、法律问题、法律关系三元组和法律推理来增强法律案例检索，通过微调大语言模型实现上下文法律案例表示学习，在两个基准数据集上显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律案例检索方法主要依赖传统词汇模型和预训练语言模型，但忽略了法律实体间丰富的关系以及揭示法律事实和法律问题如何导致司法判决的关键推理过程，这些信息反映了每个案例的独特特征，能够区分不同案例，反映了真实世界的司法过程。

Method: 设计ReaKase-8B框架，提取法律事实、法律问题、法律关系三元组和法律推理，采用微调的大语言模型实现上下文法律案例表示学习范式。

Result: 在COLIEE 2022和COLIEE 2023两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，知识和推理增强的嵌入显著提高了检索性能，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 将法律推理整合到法律案例检索系统中具有巨大潜力，ReaKase-8B框架通过利用法律推理信息有效提升了案例检索的准确性。

Abstract: Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision
making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query
case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and
pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are
rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the
crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can
lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the
distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,
mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such
information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy
of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to
leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal
reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context
legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language
model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and
COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings
substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting
the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.

Abstract: Automatic structure elucidation is essential for self-driving laboratories as
it enables the system to achieve truly autonomous. This capability closes the
experimental feedback loop, ensuring that machine learning models receive
reliable structure information for real-time decision-making and optimization.
Herein, we present DiSE, an end-to-end diffusion-based generative model that
integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities, including MS, 13C and 1H chemical
shifts, HSQC, and COSY, to achieve automated yet accurate structure elucidation
of organic compounds. By learning inherent correlations among spectra through
data-driven approaches, DiSE achieves superior accuracy, strong generalization
across chemically diverse datasets, and robustness to experimental data despite
being trained on calculated spectra. DiSE thus represents a significant advance
toward fully automated structure elucidation, with broad potential in natural
product research, drug discovery, and self-driving laboratories.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: WeaveRec是一个跨域序列推荐方法，通过交叉训练多个LoRA模块并以编织方式融合，解决了传统方法需要重叠用户/物品的限制，同时不增加推理时的延迟或内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域推荐方法依赖重叠用户或物品来建立跨域关联，这在现实场景中很少成立。虽然大语言模型和模型融合技术看似能克服这一限制，但直接在合并域上训练或简单融合多个领域特定LLM往往会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出WeaveRec方法：1）交叉训练多个LoRA模块，使用源域和目标域数据以编织方式进行训练；2）通过模型融合技术整合这些模块；3）可扩展到多源域场景，且不增加推理时的延迟或内存开销。

Result: 在单源、多源和跨平台跨域推荐场景下的广泛实验验证，WeaveRec能有效缓解性能下降，并在真实推荐任务中持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: WeaveRec通过编织式交叉训练和模型融合，成功解决了LLM在跨域推荐中的性能下降问题，提供了理论保证，并在多种实际场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user
preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite
the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or
items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in
real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and
model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying
multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows
that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several
domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained
solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first
experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based
cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we
introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and
target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.
WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not
introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the
upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments
on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation
scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation
and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation
tasks.
