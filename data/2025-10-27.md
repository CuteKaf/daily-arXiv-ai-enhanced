### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training的新方法，通过在适配器训练过程中为混淆因素提供捷径，防止适配器学习到目标属性与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）的虚假相关性，从而提高生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于适配器的训练方法在扩展基础图像生成器能力时，容易将目标属性（如主体身份）与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性限制了模型的泛化能力和对输入文本提示的遵循能力。

Method: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，在适配器训练过程中通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为混淆因素提供捷径，消除适配器内部化这些因素的动机，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，当寻求解耦表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应该学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示来指导冻结的视频扩散变换器，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制，在100个语义条件下达到38.7%的用户偏好率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: VAP将问题重新定义为上下文生成，利用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过即插即用的混合变换器专家指导冻结的视频扩散变换器，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 构建了VAP-Data数据集（超过10万个配对视频，涵盖100个语义条件），作为单一统一模型，VAP在开源方法中达到最先进水平，用户偏好率为38.7%，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点轨迹跟踪框架，通过流匹配训练和最佳优先搜索策略，能够建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前判别式点跟踪模型在不确定性情况下只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态轨迹的问题。

Method: 采用生成式框架，结合流匹配训练方法，包含迭代精炼、窗口相关先验和专门调整的方差调度，在推理时使用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪方面达到最先进水平，同时保持可见点跟踪的竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪性能，为不确定性条件下的点跟踪提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [4] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了3DReasonKnee，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含来自7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积的494k高质量五元组，支持解剖区域的3D定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以对解剖区域进行定位和逐步推理，这与临床诊断工作流程不匹配。现有3D数据集缺乏支持这种"基础推理"能力的数据。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，每个样本包含：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤、结构化严重程度评估。数据集创建涉及450+小时的专家临床医生时间。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五个最先进的视觉语言模型进行了基准测试，为3D定位和诊断准确性提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科外科医生诊断专业知识的资源库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法依赖光照和材料属性，限制了在透明、半透明和异质物体上的应用效果，需要一种不受这些因素影响的可靠重建方法。

Method: 构建偏振观测的一般理论，利用长波红外偏振成像消除模糊性，通过多视角热偏振图像恢复详细3D形状。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材料属性的可靠解决方案，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [6] [Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654)
*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏可穿戴IMU和UWB距离测量的多人全身运动跟踪方法，通过融合惯性观测和传感器间距离信息，实现精确的3D姿态估计和全局轨迹跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纯IMU方法在全局平移估计和多人相对定位方面的局限性，IMU数据本质上是自参考的，无法提供他人直接的空间参考。

Method: 使用超宽带测距(UWB)估计传感器间的绝对距离，将距离信息与惯性观测融合到结构化状态空间模型中，集成时间运动模式进行3D姿态估计；采用新颖的两步优化方法利用估计距离准确跟踪全局轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据评估中，Group Inertial Poser在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进方法；创建了首个IMU+UWB双人跟踪数据集GIP-DB，包含14名参与者的200分钟运动记录。

Conclusion: 展示了IMU+UWB基于的多人在野外运动捕捉的前景，为克服视觉方法遮挡和环境仪器化限制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的对象中心自监督适应方法，用于视觉基础模型在无标注情况下的域适应，通过多视角对象视频实现模型性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺领域性能下降的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而现有的自监督学习方法对视觉编码器模型效果不佳。

Method: 基于自蒸馏范式，利用多视角对象中心视频进行自监督微调，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术以防止预训练知识遗忘。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的综合实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法取得了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: VESSA通过多视角对象观察有效学习对变化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可实现视觉基础模型的域适应，代码已公开。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化插件式流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在复杂工业环境下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决在杂乱、光照差和复杂背景下的可靠检测问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，结合低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出的假阳性，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业拣选基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中具有有效性和实用性，能够显著提升未见物体的检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于深度学习的混合框架，用于在地震后自动检测混凝土结构中裸露的钢筋，从而评估结构损伤程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，裸露钢筋的数量和分布是结构损伤的重要指标。

Method: 使用YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和裸露钢筋，另一个YOLO模型区分不同损伤等级，结合数据增强和微调技术构建混合框架。

Result: 开发了自动分类框架，能够识别建筑物内外和结构构件，可靠地确定输入图像的损伤等级。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤背景下实现快速自动化的损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型进行开放词汇识别，生成丰富的语义场景表示，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法主要局限于单视图设置，不支持增量更新，缺乏明确的3D几何接地，这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，然后使用深度信息将其接地到3D空间。节点表示具有特征、3D位置和语义上下文的开放词汇对象，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架通过结合预训练基础模型的丰富知识和3D几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的零样本3D场景理解解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在肠道神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且与医生的决策过程不符。研究旨在通过整合专家知识来提升模型的临床相关性和性能。

Method: 使用基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合从医学教科书和论文中提取的专家文本概念，通过QuiltNet编码提示来对齐临床相关语义线索与视觉特征。

Result: 提出的模型在各项分类指标上均优于基于CNN的模型（VGG-19、ResNet-18、ResNet-50），准确率达到83.9%，精确度86.6%，特异性87.6%。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有巨大潜力，整合专家知识能够产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，用于快速低光照图像增强。该方法通过定义直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵，构建两级优化模型，在保持增强效果的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Retinex的低光照图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要开发更高效的算法来平衡增强效果和计算效率。

Method: 1. 定义直方图位置矩阵和直方图计数矩阵，建立光照、反射率和低光照图像直方图之间的关系；2. 基于先验信息和直方图Retinex模型构建两级优化模型；3. 通过求解优化模型得到光照直方图和反射率直方图的迭代公式；4. 通过直方图匹配增强低光照图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上优于现有增强方法，在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒执行时间，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: HistRetinex模型成功地将Retinex理论扩展到直方图域，实现了高效的低光照图像增强，在保持良好增强效果的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，需要智能体通过主动获取信息、整合多步观察和动态调整决策来完成推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的视觉推理主要在静态、完全可观察的环境中进行，而现实世界信息往往因遮挡或视野限制而不完整。受人类主动探索环境的能力启发，需要开发能在部分可观察环境中主动获取信息的推理系统。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR模拟基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，提供丰富的思维链标注，用于训练智能体在更高阶马尔可夫决策过程中进行不确定性识别、信息增益预测和信息最大化动作选择。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA, RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath, Geometry30K)上达到最先进性能。分析发现当前具身MLLM虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在通过交互主动获取和整合新信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体像人类一样通过主动交互来获取和整合信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过图像编辑生成仅安全相关特征不同的对比图像对，构建了包含3020张图像的安全基准，用于评估和训练视觉语言模型的安全识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标注粗糙模糊，无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征，难以系统区分良性图像和问题图像。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变。

Result: 构建了包含3020个SafetyPair图像的新安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别，有效暴露了视觉语言模型在区分细微差异图像方面的弱点，并提高了轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了一个系统研究细粒度图像安全区别的首个资源，既能作为评估数据源，也能作为有效的数据增强策略。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO是一个多模态强化学习框架，通过向视觉输入注入可控噪声来增强探索，并使用贝叶斯框架显式建模优势估计过程，以提升多模态大语言模型的链式思维推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习框架在提升通用链式思维推理能力时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够增强探索性和鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 1) 噪声注入探索策略：用高斯噪声扰动视觉输入，鼓励在更广泛的视觉场景中进行探索；2) 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推理问题，融合噪声水平和轨迹奖励信息来计算稳健的后验优势估计。

Result: 在标准链式思维质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提高了泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在使用小规模多模态大语言模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 3B）的强化学习设置中。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的噪声注入和贝叶斯优势估计，有效提升了多模态大语言模型在链式思维推理中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为小规模模型的强化学习训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，避免了碘对比剂的风险，并在血管分割和量化任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTPA依赖碘对比剂，存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。研究旨在开发一种无需对比剂就能生成类似CTPA图像的方法。

Method: 使用基于Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN)的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA。研究使用了410对CTPA和NCCT扫描，分为训练验证集和测试集。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71, SSIM: 0.98；测试集MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27, SSIM: 0.98），在血管分割任务中Dice、clDice和clRecall指标显著改善，血管体积ICC从0.70提升到0.81。

Conclusion: 提出的DCCTPA方法能够有效增强血管结构，特别是在小血管方面，为无对比剂肺血管疾病诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

*Guanlin Wu,Boyan Su,Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Yichen Lin,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了空间智能网格（SIG）作为基础模型中视觉空间智能（VSI）的补充表示方法，通过结构化网格编码物体布局和空间关系，并开发了SIGBench基准测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中视觉空间智能的评估主要依赖纯文本提示和VQA式评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，削弱了对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 引入空间智能网格（SIG）作为结构化、基于网格的模式，明确编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理基础先验，作为文本的补充通道。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比仅使用VQA表示在所有VSI指标上都产生了更大、更稳定和更全面的增益，表明其作为学习VSI的数据标注和训练模式的前景。

Conclusion: SIG提供了一个忠实、组合式的场景结构表示，用于基础模型推理，并开发了SIG-informed评估指标来量化模型的内在VSI，将空间能力与语言先验分离开来。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于CLIP的零样本异常检测框架，通过动态的token级对齐机制，将视觉token与可学习的文本子空间进行细粒度匹配，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐不同对象和领域视觉语义的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种不加区分的对齐方式阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 提出TokenCLIP框架，将token无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态地将每个视觉token分配到语义相关的子空间组合，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划以专门化不同视觉区域的子空间。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态的token级对齐机制，实现了视觉token与可学习文本子空间的细粒度匹配，有效提升了零样本异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Motivation: 从有限的真实世界视频数据中学习物理一致的动力学模型具有挑战性，特别是对于具有空间变化物理属性的可变形物体。为了解决数据稀缺问题，需要开发能够利用模拟器合成多样化物理演示的方法。

Conclusion: PhysWorld框架通过利用模拟器合成物理合理的多样化演示，有效解决了从有限真实数据学习物理一致世界模型的挑战，实现了高效准确的可变形物体动力学预测。

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Motivation: 现有静态多模态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的动态评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演化(KBE)框架，整合多模态知识重构和扩展问题，实现难度可控的动态评估。

Result: 实验表明KBE能缓解数据污染和饱和风险，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法，解决了静态基准的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，解决了现有方法在实际部署中的主要技术挑战。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成方面实现了显著的效率和精度提升，为高质量艺术家风格3D内容创建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Motivation: 3DGS虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在视觉语言导航中的应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包括：（1）对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度注释；（2）物理感知执行连接，在3DGS中嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench（含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但泛化能力强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and

*Lu Zhang,Jiazuo Yu,Haomiao Xiong,Ping Hu,Yunzhi Zhuge,Huchuan Lu,You He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineRS是一个基于多模态大语言模型的两阶段强化学习框架，用于在高分辨率场景中联合推理和分割极小的物体。它采用从粗到精的流程，包括全局语义探索和局部感知细化，通过定位感知的回顾奖励耦合两个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于输入分辨率受限，多模态大语言模型在理解高分辨率图像中的视觉细节和定位极小物体方面面临挑战，特别是在杂乱背景中的超小物体。

Method: 提出FineRS两阶段框架：1) 全局语义探索(GSE)执行指令引导的推理，生成文本响应和粗略目标区域；2) 局部感知细化(LPR)细化该区域，生成精确的边界框和分割掩码。通过定位感知的回顾奖励耦合两个阶段。

Result: 在FineRS-4k和公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上持续优于最先进的基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了MLLM在高分辨率图像中处理极小物体的挑战，通过两阶段强化学习方法实现了更好的推理和分割性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，将视觉-语言表示编码为隐藏激活，每个神经元对应一个由语义相似的图像和文本表示的概念，从而用统一的概念集解释这些表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型具有强大的多模态推理能力，但其对齐组件的可解释性尚未得到研究，主要困难在于将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集中。

Method: 构建VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，包含距离编码器和两个模态特定解码器，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，并在自监督训练中鼓励语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLMs（如CLIP、LLaVA）上的实验表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面具有优越能力，能够通过概念比较理解视觉和语言表示的对齐，并通过概念级对齐提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过将视觉-语言表示映射到统一概念集，成功解决了多模态表示对齐的可解释性问题，同时能够增强对齐效果，提升零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务性能。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORM是一个机器学习框架，用于预测扰动诱导的三维细胞结构变化，通过形态编码器和扩散模型捕捉细胞形态在扰动条件下的演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN端到端训练学习紧凑的3D细胞形状表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个3D细胞体积的大型数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能预测下游信号活性、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动状态间的形态动态转换。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

*Lemin Liu,Fangchao Hu,Honghua Jiang,Yaru Chen,Limin Liu,Yongliang Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CNN-Transformer-CLIP（CT-CLIP）多分支识别框架，结合CNN提取局部病变细节特征和Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系，通过自适应特征融合模块动态融合特征，解决苹果叶病病变形态和分布多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂果园环境中，不同苹果叶病的表型异质性（病变间显著变异）对传统多尺度特征融合方法构成挑战，这些方法仅整合CNN提取的多层特征，未能充分考虑局部与全局特征间的关系。

Method: 提出CT-CLIP多分支识别框架：使用CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系；自适应特征融合模块（AFFM）动态融合这些特征；采用多模态图像-文本学习方法，利用预训练CLIP权重实现视觉特征与疾病语义描述的深度对齐。

Result: 在公开苹果病害数据集和自建数据集上分别达到97.38%和96.12%的准确率，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提升了复杂环境条件下的识别精度，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态语义感知相关建模跟踪框架，通过动态语义相关性生成器结合Transformer的相关图来探索语义相关性，提高无人机跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪方法主要强调速度而缺乏语义感知探索，导致在相机运动、快速运动和低分辨率等典型挑战下性能不佳。

Method: 使用动态语义相关性生成器与Transformer相关图结合探索语义相关性，并设计了剪枝方法以提高跟踪速度。

Result: 在多个无人机跟踪数据集上实现了有竞争力的性能，提供了多种模型变体以在速度和准确性之间权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了无人机跟踪在典型挑战下的准确性和鲁棒性，同时提供了灵活部署选项。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用眼动数据进行训练的注视正则化框架，通过注视正则化注意力机制将模型关注与人类视觉注视对齐，显著提升了自我中心视觉语言模型在细粒度未来事件预测和当前活动理解任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动注视提供了关于注意力、短期意图和未来行动的有价值线索，是建模自我中心行为的强大信号。现有方法要么仅依赖视觉输入，要么将注视作为辅助输入信号使用，而本工作探索仅在训练时使用注视数据来增强视觉语言模型。

Method: 提出注视正则化注意力机制，在训练过程中将模型关注与人类视觉注视对齐。该方法设计灵活且模块化，可泛化到多种使用注意力机制的视觉语言模型架构。

Result: 实验结果显示，与没有注视正则化的基线模型相比，该方法在未来事件预测任务中语义预测分数提升高达11%，在当前活动理解任务中提升约7%。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了使用人类注视来增强视觉语言模型在现实场景（如辅助机器人和人机协作）中预测能力的基础，证明了注视引导训练在提高自我中心视觉语言模型准确性和鲁棒性方面的价值。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合IMPACT-Synth感知损失和两种配准策略（Elastix和IMPACT），在SynthRAD2025挑战赛中验证了配准偏差对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更鲁棒和可泛化的模型。传统基于互信息的配准方法可能导致解剖结构不一致，影响模型性能评估。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练跨解剖区域并针对每个区域进行微调。损失函数结合像素级L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估两种配准策略：Elastix（互信息）和IMPACT（基于特征的相似性度量）。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了更准确和解剖一致的配准，降低了MAE并生成更真实的解剖结构。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据的模型得分更高，反映了与评估管道一致的配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价来提升性能指标。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致的配准有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更鲁棒和可泛化的合成CT生成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Conclusion: TerraGen通过统一的布局到图像生成框架解决了遥感视觉任务中数据增强的局限性，实现了灵活、空间可控的图像合成，为多任务遥感分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度一致性约束和多阶段对齐机制，成功解决了视差引起的图像拼接问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高了算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种各向异性池化方法来改进基于查找表（LUT）的图像恢复CNN方法，替代传统的平均池化，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LUT的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 引入广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种图像恢复基准测试上的实验结果表明，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于LUT的CNN图像恢复方法的性能，相比平均池化具有明显优势。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于记忆的在线评分队列方案MoniTor，用于无需训练的在线视频异常检测，通过结合视觉语言模型和LSTM灵感机制，在实时约束下有效识别异常行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测研究主要集中在离线场景，而在线检测由于实时性和计算复杂度限制很少受到关注。本文旨在解决在线视频异常检测的固有复杂性。

Method: MoniTor采用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM启发的预测机制来捕捉时间依赖性，并设计了评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数，为LLM区分正常和异常行为提供指导。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的评估表明，MoniTor优于现有最先进方法，且无需训练即可与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，通过结合预训练大模型和时间依赖建模，在实时场景下实现了优异的异常检测性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice是一个新颖的视频修复框架，通过解耦视频修复为多帧一致图像修复和掩码区域运动传播两个子任务，引入间隔帧先验来指导修复过程，显著提升了时空稳定性和内容控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在处理严重内容退化时表现不佳，往往忽视时空稳定性，对视频后半部分的内容控制不足。为了解决这些局限性，需要开发能够更好处理时空一致性的新方法。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，采用间隔帧先验来提供时空线索。设计了CoSpliced模块执行首帧传播策略，通过拼接机制将初始帧内容扩散到后续参考帧中。还引入了精细的上下文控制器模块，在帧复制后编码连贯先验，并将拼接视频注入I2V生成主干，有效约束生成过程中的内容失真。

Result: 广泛评估表明，VidSplice在各种视频修复场景中实现了有竞争力的性能。其设计显著改善了前景对齐和运动稳定性，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦视频修复任务并引入间隔帧先验，有效解决了现有方法在时空稳定性和内容控制方面的不足，为视频修复领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC是一个用于胸部X光诊断的可解释AI框架，通过任务对齐的模式发现从BiomedCLIP分类器中提取可解释的视觉模式，在保持诊断准确性的同时提供透明解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中准确性高，但由于其黑盒性质限制了临床采用。临床医生需要透明可验证的解释来信任自动诊断并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上分解医学图像表示。使用MIMIC-CXR数据集的多模态嵌入训练100个转码器集合，发现约5000个单语义模式。

Result: 发现了涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别的约5000个单语义模式。每个模式在共享特定放射学特征的图像中表现出一致的激活行为，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式。在五个关键发现上达到竞争性诊断准确性。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明了医学AI系统可以既准确又可解释，通过从针对特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，确保发现的模式与临床决策直接相关，支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种双流架构，通过组织-细胞交互模块整合宏观组织特征和细胞级信息，使用线性复杂度的循环transformer进行细胞聚合，在病理亚型分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理基础模型虽然能捕捉全局组织上下文，但缺乏细胞级特征建模，限制了在癌症亚型分类等细粒度任务中的性能。

Method: 双流架构：1）宏观组织特征流；2）细胞聚合流，使用receptance加权的键值聚合模型（线性复杂度循环transformer）；3）双向组织-细胞交互模块实现局部细胞线索与周围组织环境的相互关注。

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，该方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对封闭区域多摄像头重叠视角下人员频繁遮挡的问题，现有方法难以有效处理，需要开发专门的多目标跟踪解决方案。

Method: 采用图加权解决方案，基于轨迹和人员特征在线更新识别标签；深入研究MOT过程的各个要素，包括特征提取、跟踪和社区搜索；配备人员位置估计模块提供额外关键信息。

Result: 在封闭区域模型记录和满足高拥挤空间要求的公开真实数据集上测试，展示了方法的优越性；分析现有MOT比较指标，得出IDF1比MOTA更适合此类比较。

Conclusion: GRAP-MOT在封闭区域多摄像头重叠视角下的人员多目标跟踪任务中表现优异，代码和数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信号处理的注意力头分析方法，能够识别文本生成模型中专门处理特定语义或视觉属性的注意力头，并通过编辑少量注意力头（仅1%）来可靠地控制模型输出中的目标概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚。本研究旨在理解文本生成模型中单个注意力头如何专门处理特定语义或视觉属性。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释使用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，以原则性方式分析多个样本，并根据注意力头与目标概念的相关性进行排序。

Result: 研究发现在单模态和多模态transformer中，注意力头层面存在一致的专业化模式。通过该方法选择的仅1%注意力头进行编辑，就能可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。在语言任务（如问答和毒性缓解）以及视觉语言任务（如图像分类和描述）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力层内存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

Motivation: 现有视觉编码器主要关注全局图像表示，但忽视了细粒度区域分析，在细粒度感知方面存在限制，主要原因是细粒度标注数据稀缺且缺乏细粒度预训练范式。

Method: 构建Gran-29M数据集；开发预训练-适应框架，在预训练阶段使用边界框到标题回归增强局部视觉表示，在适应阶段使用标题到边界框回归改善视觉特征利用和定位；引入自蒸馏机制加强区域推理能力。

Result: GranViT超越了现有视觉编码器，在不同LLMs上表现出强大的可迁移性。在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解方面取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: GranViT通过细粒度区域级训练和语义对齐，显著提升了视觉编码器的细粒度感知能力，在多模态任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，并引入了Foresight Guidance (FSG)方法，通过在早期扩散阶段解决更长间隔子问题来提高图像质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择。需要统一的理论框架来理解和改进条件引导机制。

Method: 将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，寻找黄金路径使得潜在变量在条件和无条件生成下产生一致输出。提出Foresight Guidance (FSG)，在早期扩散阶段优先解决更长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并开启了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley音效生成方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型强性能的同时，通过最小化训练参数实现视频与音频的同步。

Method: 将V-JEPA2视频嵌入连接到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力层，使用池化视频token以减少内存需求并稳定训练。

Result: 在精选的视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现具有竞争力，训练参数远少于最近的多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和生产友好的模块化。

Conclusion: Foley Control提供了一种高效、模块化的视频引导Foley生成解决方案，该桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态（如语音）。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出潜力，但面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时序动态特性。

Method: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'来捕捉流匹配的内在时序动态，并在块级别优化策略，同时引入可选的加权采样策略进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式超分辨率方法在处理自然图像时表现良好，但在处理文本时会扭曲文字，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架，明确将字形恢复与图像增强解耦：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用这些结构指导后续的全图像超分辨率。

Result: 大量实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提升了可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过字形到图像的引导机制，成功解决了文本超分辨率中图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡问题，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过大规模合成数据生成和模糊感知架构显著提升显著目标检测泛化能力的方法，包括创建139,000+高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集和能处理模糊性的多掩码解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测面临像素级标注成本高的问题，导致相关子任务需要分别训练模型，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道从扩散和DINO-v3特征中提取标签，创建大规模合成数据集S3OD；提出迭代生成框架优先处理困难类别；设计流线型多掩码解码器预测多个有效解释。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化上实现20-50%错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构有效解决了显著目标检测的数据限制问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Yuan Wang,Jiawei Du,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Mingkun Xu,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑策略解决资源受限场景下模型过度自信和性能退化问题，在少量训练数据和计算资源下实现竞争性检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限场景中，现有跨模态对齐模型（如CLIP）面临过度自信和性能退化问题，主要原因是数据质量差和对比学习方法对不确定样本的过度强化。

Method: 采用随机扰动引入受控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布，共同降低过度自信并提升噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间即达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

### [53] [Epipolar Geometry Improves Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21615)
*Orest Kupyn,Fabian Manhardt,Federico Tombari,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于极几何约束的视频生成方法，通过偏好优化对齐扩散模型，解决现有视频生成模型中的几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然通过大规潜扩散变换器和整流流技术取得了进展，但仍然存在几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影等问题，破坏了真实3D场景的幻觉。3D一致性的视频生成对生成和重建任务具有重要影响。

Method: 使用成对极几何约束通过偏好优化对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法无需端到端可微分性，高效地强制执行几何原理。在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练，确保高质量测量，同时模型能有效泛化到各种动态内容。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，后者产生噪声目标会损害对齐质量。该方法在保持视觉质量的同时，生成了空间一致的视频。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，可在不损害视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

*Ziqi Gao,Qiufu Li,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAP-MAE是一种针对点云数据的跨域自适应掩码自编码器预训练方法，通过异构域适配器和域特征生成器，解决不同领域点云数据混合预训练时知识对齐不佳的问题，在单一预训练下实现多个下游任务的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练数据规模有限，现有方法混合不同领域数据进行MAE预训练，但学到的先验知识与下游3D点云分析任务可能不对齐，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DAP-MAE方法，包含异构域适配器（预训练时使用适应模式，微调时使用融合模式）和域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个不同点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能够自适应整合跨域数据集知识，有效提升点云分析的通用性，解决了混合域预训练中的知识对齐问题。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

*Han Yang,Guangjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gompertz-CNN动态知识蒸馏框架，通过Gompertz增长模型动态调整蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配，在CIFAR数据集上相比传统方法提升准确率最高8%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演变过程，导致知识传递效果不佳

Method: 基于Gompertz曲线的阶段感知蒸馏策略，动态调整蒸馏损失权重；使用Wasserstein距离度量特征级差异，梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为；多损失目标统一这些组件

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用不同师生架构（如ResNet50和MobileNet_v2），Gompertz-CNN始终优于传统蒸馏方法，在CIFAR-10上准确率提升最高8%，CIFAR-100上提升最高4%

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN通过模拟人类学习过程的动态特性，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，为动态知识传递提供了新思路

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了长尾识别方法在野生动物物种识别中的应用，在NACTI数据集上实现了99.40%的Top-1准确率，显著优于95.51%的基线，并在跨域测试中展示了更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然世界数据收集通常存在严重的类别不平衡问题，NACTI数据集中最大的'Head'类别占整个数据集的50%以上。为解决这一长尾分布问题，需要系统研究长尾识别方法在野生动物物种识别中的有效性。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究了多种长尾识别损失函数和LTR敏感正则化方法，构建了减少偏差的测试集来评估域偏移情况。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40% Top-1准确率，显著优于95.51%的基线；在跨域测试中达到52.55%准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强调度器选择与先进LTR损失函数结合在野生动物领域表现一致改进，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决某些问题，包括在严重域偏移下对'Tail'类别的灾难性失效。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于邻近突触相似性的无监督方法，用于在电子显微镜图像中对突触进行分类，无需预先知道突触类型数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要监督学习，而该方法仅利用同一神经元中邻近突触比随机选择的突触更相似的观察，无需预先标记。

Method: 基于邻近突触相似性原理，开发无监督分类方法，应用于果蝇数据。

Result: 成功分离突触为不同类别，无需预先知道类型数量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性的方式来选择覆盖突触结构范围的地面实况，具有无需预先知道类型数量的优势。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器在皮肤病理学全玻片图像分类中的性能，发现Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现更优，逻辑回归达到90%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，以支持皮肤病理学诊断。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入特征，通过均值聚合策略生成玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归模型达到90%准确率，但差异无统计学显著性。均值聚合方法提供了可靠的玻片级特征表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化全玻片图像分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为未来玻片级表示学习的进展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个用于无限扩展3D场景合成的分层框架，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，解决现有方法在几何一致性、可扩展性和场景级生成方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致问题，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型大多面向对象而非场景级生成。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：(1)数据整理流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；(2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: WorldGrow展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

TL;DR: BachVid是一种无需训练的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，实现无需参考图像的多视频一致生成，确保前景和背景的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在生成多个视频时难以保持角色和背景一致性的问题，现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只解决角色一致性。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，发现其在去噪过程中能够提取前景掩码和识别匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明，BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型作为几何求解器的潜力，解决长期存在的几何难题，如内接正方形问题，并扩展至其他复杂几何问题。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型从高斯噪声生成近似有效解的图像，通过图像生成实现几何推理。

Result: 模型成功学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置，在多个几何问题上获得接近精确解的近似解。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作提供了一个通用且实用的框架来近似解决困难几何问题，为处理更广泛几何任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合代码执行和少样本学习，让标准指令微调语言模型无需额外训练就能达到或超越专门推理模型的性能，同时更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型虽然成功但训练和运行成本高，而标准指令语言模型可能已经具备强大的推理能力，只是需要合适的激发方式。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在推理过程中交替使用自然语言和代码执行）和少量训练问题的少样本引导式上下文学习。

Result: 在四个模型对和八个任务上的测试显示，CodeAdapt让三个语言模型平均性能超越对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提高10-81%，在六个任务上平均表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础良好且强大的系统，可能为权重内强化学习提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 该论文构建了FICSIM数据集，用于评估语言模型在计算文学研究中的嵌入相似性能力，发现现有模型倾向于关注表面特征而非语义类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理长文本能力的提升，在计算文学研究中应用这些模型的需求增长，但评估其有效性面临挑战，包括长文本细粒度标注成本高、公共领域文学数据污染问题，以及现有嵌入相似性数据集不适合文学领域任务。

Method: 构建并发布FICSIM数据集，包含长篇小说文本，基于作者提供的元数据在12个相似性维度上进行评分，并由数字人文学者验证；评估了一系列嵌入模型在该任务上的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，各模型普遍倾向于关注表面特征，而非对计算文学研究任务有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集为评估语言模型在文学领域的嵌入相似性能力提供了合适基准，揭示了当前模型在语义理解方面的局限性，同时在数据收集过程中优先考虑作者权益和知情同意。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型从美国最高法院案例中识别推翻关系的能力。

Result: 评估揭示了三个关键限制：时代敏感性（模型在历史案例上表现较差）、浅层推理（依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解）、上下文依赖的推理失败（在复杂任务中产生时间上不可能的关系）。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个基准，解决了现实长上下文评估中的关键空白，提供了一个反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 爱尔兰-BLiMP是首个为爱尔兰语设计的细粒度语言能力评估数据集和框架，包含1020个最小对，涵盖11种语言特征。评估显示人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有LLM模型，准确率高出16.6%。开源和闭源LLM之间存在18.1%的性能差距，最强模型仅达到73.5%准确率，而人类为90.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为爱尔兰语（一种濒危语言）创建首个系统性的语言能力评估框架，以评估大型语言模型在低资源语言中的语法理解能力。

Method: 基于语言学文献和语法参考书，由流利的爱尔兰语使用者团队手动构建和审查1020个最小对，涵盖11种语言特征的分类体系。评估现有LLM和流利人类参与者的爱尔兰语句法知识。

Result: 人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有模型，平均准确率高16.6%。开源和闭源LLM之间存在18.1%的性能差距，最强模型gpt-5仅达到73.5%准确率，而人类为90.1%。人类和模型在不同语法方面存在困难，表明模型学习的表征存在差异。

Conclusion: 爱尔兰-BLiMP为评估LLM在爱尔兰语中的语法能力提供了首个系统性框架，为推进低资源语言理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [66] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了置信度门控的思维链（CoT）技术，通过训练无关的置信度估计方法来判断何时需要启用CoT推理，以减少不必要的token使用并提升模型实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示虽然能提升大语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力，但会显著增加token使用量，且在某些任务中可能无益甚至有害。现有模型虽然提供了控制CoT长度的功能，但用户不清楚何时应该使用CoT。

Method: 提出置信度门控CoT方法，当模型对直接回答的置信度较低时才启用推理。评估了四种训练无关的置信度估计方法，并与随机基准和理想情况下的oracle进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，现有的训练无关置信度度量方法能够减少冗余的CoT使用，并优于随机启用CoT的情况。但不同置信度度量的有效性不一致，随数据集和模型变化，实际部署仍存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前置信度门控CoT方法的潜力和局限性，为开发更可靠的自适应CoT门控技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了在低误报率要求下的推理增强分类任务，发现在精度敏感场景中，推理增强反而表现不佳，而关闭推理的模式在低误报率下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理在精度敏感任务中的适用性，特别是在低误报率要求下的分类任务表现。

Method: 在两个任务（安全检测和幻觉检测）上评估微调和零样本设置，使用标准LLM和大型推理模型，比较推理开启和关闭两种模式。

Result: 推理增强提高整体准确率但在低误报率阈值下表现不佳；关闭推理在精度敏感场景中表现更好；基于token的评分优于自我置信度；两种模式的简单集成能结合各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：对平均准确率有益，但往往不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和筛选演示示例来实现上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，适用于黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前上下文知识编辑方法中存在的数量-质量权衡问题和缺乏任务难度适应性的问题。

Method: 训练BERT检索器使用REINFORCE算法按编辑奖励对演示进行排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提高17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持无关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，为黑盒LLM提供了有效的梯度无关编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，为解决印尼语等低资源语言的问答需求，需要开发专门的自适应RAG系统。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器来确定回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强以克服印尼语数据集有限的挑战。

Result: 开发了可靠的问题复杂度分类器，但在多检索回答策略中观察到显著的不一致性，这对整体评估产生了负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了低资源语言问答系统的潜力和挑战，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标，针对RAG系统中LLM处理检索结果的特点，改进传统IR指标，通过考虑相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，以及与端到端答案准确性的相关性优化，显著提升了评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序浏览文档的假设，在RAG系统中不适用，因为LLM会整体处理所有检索文档，且干扰文档会主动降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能。

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关段落的正面贡献和干扰段落的负面影响；提出UDCG指标，使用LLM导向的位置折扣，直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提升了高达36%。

Conclusion: 该工作为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，实现了对RAG组件更可靠的评估。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统对提高临床决策质量至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集，特别是非英语数据集，阻碍了该领域的发展。

Method: 构建了包含5,894条去标识化记录的中文药物推荐数据集CDrugRed，涵盖患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多个最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，监督微调能提高模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更稳健准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过自奖励机制改善LLM的泛化性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法存在过拟合和泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。需要一种能够利用演示数据进行更有效对齐的方法。

Method: 结合SFT和PPO，设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的自奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调。

Result: 在多种NLP任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的场景下。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO通过自奖励机制有效解决了SFT的局限性，提高了LLM的对齐效果、泛化能力和数据效率。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

TL;DR: 提出了VeriGray基准测试，通过引入Out-Dependent类别解决摘要忠实性评估中的标注模糊问题，发现即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有忠实性基准测试存在标注模糊问题，主要由于生成输出中允许的外部知识边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实性标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准测试。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准测试对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊对于不忠实检测基准测试至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语义理解和生成方面表现出色，但其黑盒性质限制了结构化推理能力；而文本属性图提供显式关系结构但缺乏语义深度。结合两者可以产生互补优势，增强图表示学习并提高LLM的推理和可解释性。

Method: 引入新颖的分类法，包括两个基本方向：LLM用于TAG（LLM丰富基于图的任务）和TAG用于LLM（结构化图改进LLM推理）。将编排策略分为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论TAG特定预训练、提示和参数高效微调的进展。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并突出了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等领域的多样化应用。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和TAG在语言和图学习的交叉领域具有巨大潜力，但仍面临开放挑战，需要未来研究进一步探索和改进集成方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个分析LLMs在社会模拟中行为的系统框架，通过聊天室式多智能体交互和五个语言维度分析，发现LLMs不能忠实再现真实人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，存在社会期望偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠模拟人类行为对于解释、预测和干预社会至关重要。虽然LLMs在模拟人类行为、互动和决策方面显示出潜力，但LLMs在社会环境中与真实人类行为的差异程度尚未充分探索，存在科学研究和实际应用中误解的风险。

Method: 引入一个系统框架分析LLMs在社会模拟中的行为，通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体交互，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，提供简单有效的方法来检查涌现的社会认知偏差。

Result: 对三个家族的八个代表性LLMs进行广泛实验，发现LLMs不能忠实再现真实人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，受到社会期望偏差的影响。LLMs表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极性偏差，导致缺乏真实人类互动复杂性和变异性的"乌托邦"社会。

Conclusion: 这些发现呼吁需要更多社会基础化的LLMs，能够捕捉人类社会行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and

### [78] [Correlation Dimension of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21258)
*Xin Du,Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文引入相关维数这一分形几何度量来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，揭示了传统评估指标的局限性，并展示了该方法在检测模型训练阶段、上下文复杂性、幻觉倾向和文本退化方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言生成方面取得了显著进展，但仍表现出重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为，即使困惑度较低。这凸显了传统评估指标强调局部预测准确性而忽视长程结构复杂性的局限性。

Method: 引入相关维数作为分形几何度量，用于量化语言模型感知的文本自相似性和认识论复杂性。该方法计算高效，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于自回归架构。

Result: 实验表明相关维数能够：(1)揭示预训练过程中的三个不同阶段；(2)反映上下文依赖的复杂性；(3)指示模型的幻觉倾向；(4)可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 相关维数提供了一个统一的框架来捕捉语言的分层递归结构，为理解大语言模型的生成动态提供了新的视角，并且具有计算高效、鲁棒性强和广泛适用的特点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

*Xinghao Wang,Pengyu Wang,Dong Zhang,Chenkun Tan,Shaojun Zhou,Zhaoxiang Liu,Shiguo Lian,Fangxu Liu,Kai Song,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PBS-Attn的置换块稀疏注意力方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏性，从而在保持模型精度的同时显著提升长上下文预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的上下文长度扩展具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要由于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有的块稀疏注意力方法在块级稀疏性上可能不够优化。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，通过置换注意力机制来增加块级稀疏性，并开发了自定义的置换FlashAttention内核来实现端到端加速。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型精度上优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近全注意力基线，在长上下文预填充中实现了最高2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的高效注意力方法，能够显著提升长上下文处理的计算效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

### [80] [PARL: Prompt-based Agents for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21306)
*Yarik Menchaca Resendiz,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL是一种使用大型语言模型作为强化学习智能体的方法，通过提示工程实现，无需微调。该方法在非语言推理任务中表现良好，但在复杂数学运算任务中存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在语言相关任务中的表现，但缺乏对其在强化学习环境中作为智能体的能力评估，特别是在非语言结构化推理任务中。

Method: 提出PARL方法，通过提示工程将动作、状态和奖励编码到提示中，使LLMs能够通过试错与环境交互，无需进行模型微调。

Result: 在三个标准RL任务中，PARL在简单环境中能够匹配或超越传统RL智能体，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中表现受限。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的RL智能体，特别是在利用预训练知识的简单环境中，但在处理复杂数学运算方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

### [81] [Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310)
*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过在解码过程中注入语义相似性惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中，准确估计大语言模型的语义不确定性通常需要大量昂贵的生成，因此需要更高效的采样方法。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，涵盖自回归和掩码扩散范式，并通过重要性重加权和方差缩减技术优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个问答基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下匹配或超越基线方法，覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该框架作为模块化增强工具，无需访问基础LLM的梯度，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [82] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了NLP模型在字符顺序混乱（typoglycemia）情况下仍能保持良好性能的原因，发现主要原因是英语中实际发生混淆的词汇较少，且混淆词汇的上下文差异明显，使得消歧变得简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解为什么某些NLP模型在字符内部顺序混乱的情况下仍能表现出强大的鲁棒性，特别是当不同词汇（如form和from）在这种混乱下会变成相同表示时，模型如何有效工作。

Method: 研究方法包括：(1)分析英国国家语料库以量化typoglycemia下的词汇混淆和歧义程度；(2)评估BERT模型在消歧混淆形式方面的能力；(3)通过对比在干净文本和typoglycemic维基百科文本上从头训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 结果显示，字符混乱导致的性能下降比预期要小，证实了英语中实际发生混淆的词汇数量有限，且混淆词汇通常出现在差异明显的上下文中，使得消歧相对容易。

Conclusion: 结论是NLP模型对typoglycemia的鲁棒性主要源于英语词汇系统中实际混淆的词汇较少，以及上下文信息在消歧中的重要作用，这解释了为什么模型在字符顺序混乱时仍能保持良好性能。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

### [83] [TripTide: A Benchmark for Adaptive Travel Planning under Disruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21329)
*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是第一个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修订行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重性和旅行者容忍度等关键维度，从多个角度评估LLM的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但无法有效处理现实旅行中常见的中断情况，如航班取消、天气关闭等。

Method: 提出TripTide基准，采用三重评估方法：自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）、LLM作为评判者自动评估、专家手动评估语义、空间、序列和响应方面的质量。

Result: LLM在序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小。然而，随着计划长度增加，中断处理能力下降，表明LLM鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前LLM在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

*Qiang Liu,Wuganjing Song,Zhenzhou Lin,Feifan Chen,Qiaolong Cai,Chen Li,Yongduo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练在大语言模型推理任务中比多轮训练更有效，单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都表现良好，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用通常涉及多轮人机交互，但大语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，这可能导致训练与部署条件不匹配。研究旨在探索多轮训练是否对推理任务必要。

Method: 比较了传统的单轮训练与三种多轮训练策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮设置下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都有效泛化，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。多轮训练仅提供有限益处，甚至可能损害推理能力。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练仍然更有效可靠，多轮训练基本反馈提供的益处有限且可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手动编写问答基准数据集，用于测试模型对瑞典特定知识的掌握程度。研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖范围的小型模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面的表现与规模大三倍的多语言模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多瑞典基准测试都是翻译自美国中心的基准测试，不适合测试与瑞典特别相关或特定的知识。因此需要专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件创建问答基准。

Method: 研究人员手动编写了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准数据集，注释者从瑞典文化媒体界的公众人物和主要体育赛事中获取灵感。数据集包含英文翻译，可用于测量不同规模和瑞典覆盖程度的模型的事实回忆能力。

Result: 使用该数据集发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖范围的小型模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面的表现与规模大三倍的多语言模型相当。继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集有潜力作为诊断工具，用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留，以及在语言适应过程中的表现。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型在NLP领域取得了革命性进展，但许多形态丰富的语言在大规模预训练中仍然代表性不足。作者旨在为土耳其语开发首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 从零开始训练SindBERT模型，使用312GB土耳其语文本数据（包括mC4、OSCAR23和维基百科），发布了基础和大型两种配置。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现优异，大型变体在四个任务中的两个取得最佳成绩，但整体上没有一致的规模扩展优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT既为土耳其语NLP提供了开放资源，也作为实证案例研究，揭示了在形态丰富语言中模型规模扩展的局限性以及语料构成的核心作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Conclusion: HalleluBERT展示了完全收敛的单语预训练的优势，为希伯来语NLP提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出多奖励优化（MRO）方法，通过增强扩散语言模型中的标记相关性来提高推理性能，同时实现采样加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）在推理性能上落后于自回归大语言模型（LLMs），主要原因是去噪步骤中标记的独立生成未能捕捉标记相关性。

Method: 提出多奖励优化（MRO）方法，利用测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来直接优化标记相关性，并引入组步和重要性采样策略来减少奖励方差和提高采样效率。

Result: 实验表明MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准高表现的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 增强标记相关性可以有效提升扩散语言模型的推理能力，MRO方法为DLMs在推理任务上的性能改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型是否对语言谱系结构敏感，发现谱系效应存在但受训练资源可用性强烈影响，不同LLM家族采用不同的多语言策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在多语言行为中的变化，特别是语言谱系结构在塑造这种变化中的作用，该领域尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过扩展MultiQ数据集上的先前分析，首先检查当提示语言保真度未保持时，模型是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言；然后调查知识一致性在谱系内部是否比跨谱系更好保持。

Result: 谱系水平效应存在但受训练资源可用性强烈影响，观察到不同LLM家族采用不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLM编码了谱系水平结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，需要超越表面语言能力的更具挑战性评估，特别是语用学能力，即理解情境意义、语言和文化规范的能力。

Method: 创建了斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准，包含405个选择题，讨论了翻译困难，建立了人类基线，并进行了LLM的初步评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有显著改进，但在推断非字面表达中的隐含意义（特别是文化特定表达）方面仍有困难，且专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类反应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Motivation: 语言文档中的词汇数据收集常包含转录错误和未记录的借词，这些会误导语言分析，因此需要系统方法来提高数据质量。

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音系特征的无监督异常检测算法，识别词汇表中的音系不一致性。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法，尽管精度和召回率因异常性质微妙而保持适中，但高召回方法为田野工作者提供了系统验证条目。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言文档提供了系统标记需要验证条目的方法，支持数据质量改进。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现出色，但在金融领域的股票预测任务中应用不足。研究发现现有模型过度依赖分析师观点，缺乏系统性独立分析逻辑，且未能有效权衡对抗性证据。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动，鼓励模型从多样化信息源动态构建分析框架，基于框架而非上下文观点组织和评分证据，最后通过反思得出预测。

Result: 构建了大规模数据集（2024年全年5123只A股，32K长上下文，20万+样本），实验表明RETuning成功解锁了模型在金融领域的推理能力，即使在6个月后或分布外股票上推理时间缩放仍然有效。

Conclusion: RETuning方法使模型获得了关于股票预测的宝贵洞察，确保独立逻辑推理并减少上下文的不当影响，有效提升了金融预测任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Motivation: 理解人类推理中信息如何动态积累和转化一直是认知心理学、哲学和人工智能的挑战。现有方法无法提供统一的人类推理动态定量描述。

Method: 引入信息流追踪(IF-Track)，使用大语言模型作为概率编码器，在推理的每个步骤量化信息熵和增益，通过细粒度分析建模推理行为。

Result: IF-Track成功捕捉了基本推理特征，识别系统性错误模式，表征个体差异，并调和了单过程与双过程理论，发现了人工与人类认知的对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了理论与测量之间的定量桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性见解，展示了LLMs如何重塑人类推理过程。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于脑机接口（BCI）的实时注意力监测系统，使用非侵入式EEG头带记录脑电波活动，通过机器学习算法分类注意和非注意状态，准确率达88.77%，并提供实时反馈以改善学习专注度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习普及使得实时监测学生专注度变得重要。传统问卷方法需要人工干预，摄像头监控无法准确反映认知参与度，现有BCI方法缺乏实时验证评估。

Method: 使用FocusCalm EEG头带收集20名参与者观看教育视频时的脑电数据，采用滑动窗口分割、巴特沃斯带通滤波、去除眼电伪影，提取时频域、小波和统计特征，使用SVM和递归特征消除进行分类。

Result: 留一交叉验证准确率达到88.77%。试点研究表明，提供实时反馈后参与者专注度显著改善（t=5.73，p=0.007）。

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效实时监测和改善学习专注度，为在线教育提供了可靠的注意力评估工具。

Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring
of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire
assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to
provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by
mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based
approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address
these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a
non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record
brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data
were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational
video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire
assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window),
filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG
artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical
features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE)
with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention
states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been
tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention
state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a
10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback
followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if
participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A
paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant
improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

TL;DR: 对四个大型语言模型生成的150万职业人物形象进行审计，发现AI在职业人物描绘中存在系统性偏见和刻板印象夸大，白人和黑人被低估，西班牙裔和亚裔被高估，某些职业的种族描绘极度扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具越来越多地用于创建职业人物形象，需要关注种族和性别如何被呈现，以及不同AI安全承诺和来源国模型的表现差异。

Method: 对来自四个不同国家（美国、中国、法国）的大型语言模型生成的41个美国职业的150多万个人物形象进行大规模审计，并与美国劳工统计局数据进行对比。

Result: 发现两个重复模式：系统性偏移（某些群体持续被低估或高估）和刻板印象夸大（现有的人口统计偏差被放大）。白人和黑人平均被低估31%和9%，西班牙裔和亚裔被高估17%和12%。某些职业的种族描绘极度扭曲，如清洁工被描绘为近100%西班牙裔。

Conclusion: 对于人机交互领域，这些发现表明提供商选择会实质性地改变可见性，需要针对特定模型的审计和负责任的设计实践。

Abstract: Generative AI tools are increasingly used to create portrayals of people in
occupations, raising concerns about how race and gender are represented. We
conducted a large-scale audit of over 1.5 million occupational personas across
41 U.S. occupations, generated by four large language models with different AI
safety commitments and countries of origin (U.S., China, France). Compared with
Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we find two recurring patterns: systematic
shifts, where some groups are consistently under- or overrepresented, and
stereotype exaggeration, where existing demographic skews are amplified. On
average, White (--31pp) and Black (--9pp) workers are underrepresented, while
Hispanic (+17pp) and Asian (+12pp) workers are overrepresented. These
distortions can be extreme: for example, across all four models, Housekeepers
are portrayed as nearly 100\% Hispanic, while Black workers are erased from
many occupations. For HCI, these findings show provider choice materially
changes who is visible, motivating model-specific audits and accountable design
practices.

Motivation: 当前教育中使用通用大型语言模型容易直接给出答案，这可能会阻碍学生的概念理解和批判性思维发展，因此需要研究如何通过提示生成促进主动学习。

Method: 针对中学科学主题，探索大型语言模型生成提示链的能力，比较静态预生成提示和根据学习者进度调整的动态提示两种策略，通过41名参与者的定量研究进行分析。

Result: 发现学习者对不同提示策略有不同偏好，自动评估指标难以捕捉这些偏好差异，揭示了当前评估方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来提示生成和智能辅导系统的设计提供了关键考虑因素，强调需要开发以学习者为中心的教育技术。

Abstract: Large language models are influencing the education landscape, with students
relying on them in their learning process. Often implemented using
general-purpose models, these systems are likely to give away the answers,
which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the
role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active
engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the
answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we
explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that
scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting
strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints,
adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41
participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to
hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation
metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for
future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek
to develop learner-centered educational technologies.

Abstract: With the current progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its
increasingly broader applications, trust is seen as a required criterion for AI
usage, acceptance, and deployment. A robust measurement instrument is essential
to correctly evaluate trust from a human-centered perspective. This paper
describes the development and validation process of a trust measure instrument,
which follows psychometric principles, and consists of a 16-items trust scale.
The instrument was built explicitly for research in human-AI interaction to
measure trust attitudes towards AI systems from layperson (non-expert)
perspective. The use-case we used to develop the scale was in the context of AI
medical support systems (specifically cancer/health prediction). The scale
development (Measurement Item Development) and validation (Measurement Item
Evaluation) involved six research stages: item development, item evaluation,
survey administration, test of dimensionality, test of reliability, and test of
validity. The results of the six-stages evaluation show that the proposed trust
measurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically
measuring and comparing non-experts' trust in AI Medical Support Systems.

TL;DR: CESAR是一个用于音频大语言模型的强化学习框架，通过奖励推理过程而非结果验证，解决了推理链越长性能越差的测试时逆缩放问题，在多个音频理解任务上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理能力研究不足，现有模型在推理过程中存在测试时逆缩放现象——推理链越长性能反而越差，这源于缺乏对推理过程的适当训练指导。

Method: 提出CESAR框架，采用在线强化学习，使用Group Relative Policy优化和多方面奖励机制，激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上大幅超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平，同时提升了多模态推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为音频大语言模型开发稳健且可扩展的推理能力提供了原则性方法，证明通过适当的训练指导可以将推理从性能负担转变为性能增益。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态学习范式"负向学习"，通过主导模态动态引导弱模态抑制非目标类，而非强制对齐，以解决模态不平衡问题并保留弱模态的独特信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中存在的模态不平衡问题，传统方法强制弱模态与主导模态对齐会抑制弱模态的独特信息，需要新的学习范式来平衡模态间的关系。

Method: 提出了多模态负向学习框架，通过动态引导机制让主导模态指导弱模态抑制非目标类，而非增强目标类预测，从而稳定决策空间并保留模态特定信息。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法通过增加单模态置信度边界来收紧多模态学习的鲁棒性下界，并在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力，特别是在噪声和不平衡场景下能减少弱模态的经验误差。

Conclusion: 负向学习范式为多模态学习提供了新的视角，能够有效解决模态不平衡问题，在保留弱模态独特信息的同时提升整体学习性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户实验评估了AI辅助在睡眠医学中的效果，比较了黑盒AI、透明白盒AI在不同时机（开始评分时或质量控制审查时）对专业医师评分性能的影响。结果显示透明AI辅助作为质量控制步骤能显著提升性能，虽然耗时增加但更受医师青睐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解释方面已能匹配或超越人类专家，但有效整合到临床实践需要解决医生何时以及为何信任算法建议的问题。研究旨在探索AI辅助的类型和时机如何影响临床工作流程。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用导向的用户研究，在三种条件下对多导睡眠图中的夜间唤醒事件进行评分：手动评分、黑盒AI辅助、透明白盒AI辅助。辅助在评分开始时或作为事后质量控制审查提供。

Result: AI和人类-AI团队在临床标准评估中显著优于未辅助专家，协作减少了评分者间变异性。透明AI辅助作为质量控制步骤比黑盒辅助提升约30%的事件级性能，质量控制时机进一步改善计数结果。白盒和质量控制方法增加评分时间，但开始时的辅助更快且更受参与者偏好。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助能有效平衡准确性和临床效率，为可信AI整合和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种热感知的RAG（HA-RAG）推理优化系统，通过混合精度压缩和热感知数据放置策略，显著提升了检索增强生成模型的推理效率，在TTFT指标上实现了2.10倍的平均加速和10.49倍的最大加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）通过引入外部知识库提高模型输出准确性，但带来了长上下文处理挑战，显著增加了内存消耗和推理延迟。现有方法通过预计算知识库的KV对并按需加载来加速推理，但仍有优化空间。

Method: 1. 基于KV块访问频率的热感知混合精度压缩和加载方法，减少磁盘I/O和内存访问开销
2. 热感知数据放置策略，优先将频繁访问的KV块存储在高速内存中以提高数据访问效率

Result: 与TurboRAG相比，HA-RAG在Time-To-First-Token（TTFT）指标上实现了平均2.10倍和最大10.49倍的加速，且精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: HA-RAG系统通过热感知的优化策略有效解决了RAG推理中的性能瓶颈，为大规模知识库的实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

TL;DR: 本文开发了基于大偏差和亚稳态分析的技术工具，揭示了重尾SGD在深度学习中的现象：通过在训练阶段注入并截断重尾噪声，SGD几乎可以完全避免尖锐最小值，并在测试数据上获得更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGD及其变体推动了现代人工智能发展，但理论理解远落后于实证成功。需要超越传统的局部收敛分析，全面理解SGD的全局动态，特别是其避免尖锐局部最小值的能力。

Method: 基于Wang和Rhee (2023)的大偏差和亚稳态分析，开发技术工具来刻画重尾SGD的全局动态，通过在训练阶段注入并截断重尾噪声。

Result: 揭示了重尾SGD可以几乎完全避免尖锐最小值，找到几何更平坦的局部最小值，并在测试数据上实现更好的泛化性能。仿真和深度学习实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 重尾SGD结合梯度裁剪能够找到更平坦的局部最小值，从而获得更好的泛化性能，这为理解SGD避免尖锐最小值的机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Motivation: 当精确的目标标签由于成本高昂或固有不确定性而无法获得时，只能获得目标值的上下界区间，传统回归损失函数无法使用，需要开发适用于区间目标的回归方法。

Method: 1. 使用与区间目标兼容的损失函数，基于假设类的平滑性建立非渐近泛化界；2. 提出min-max学习框架：在提供的区间内最小化对抗最坏情况（最大化）的目标标签，通过加入平滑性约束解决非凸最大化问题。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明所提方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 提出的两种方法有效解决了区间目标回归问题，其中min-max学习框架通过平滑性约束实现了良好的性能，为无法获得精确目标标签的回归任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于元学习的蛋白质突变属性预测方法，通过模型无关元学习和新型突变编码策略，显著提升了跨数据集泛化能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质突变属性预测方法依赖针对特定数据集的微调，但由于实验条件异质性和目标域数据有限，难以实现跨数据集泛化。

Method: 结合模型无关元学习和新型突变编码策略，使用分隔符标记将突变直接融入序列上下文，通过最小梯度步骤实现快速适应新任务。

Result: 在三个不同蛋白质突变数据集上的评估显示，相比传统微调方法，元学习方法在功能适应性预测中准确率提升29%，训练时间减少65%；在溶解度预测中准确率提升94%，训练时间减少55%。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了元学习在蛋白质突变分析中的系统性应用，提供了有效的突变编码策略，为蛋白质工程中的跨域泛化提供了变革性方法。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可逆性的模型自由强化学习安全方法，通过模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略的安全性，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型自由强化学习缺乏正式安全保证，现有方法通常需要详细的安全规范知识，而许多难以规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征。

Method: 利用可逆性作为防止训练过程中安全问题的方法，使用模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，仅需查询黑盒动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提算法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度。

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够有效提供强化学习训练过程中的安全保证，且不需要显式的动态模型或安全约束知识。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD，通过将辩论重构为非零和博弈来解决传统竞争性辩论中的辩论黑客问题，显著提升了大型语言模型的错误检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的自诊断在复杂任务上往往不可靠，需要可靠的外部反馈。传统多智能体辩论协议将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论黑客现象——辩论者倾向于误导法官而非寻求真相，反而引入更多错误。

Method: 提出协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD，将辩论重构为非零和博弈，鼓励多个智能体以支持性方式相互批评，从而相互补充缺失的观点，为法官提供更全面的证据。

Result: 实验表明，ColMAD显著优于之前的竞争性多智能体辩论方法19%，并在错误检测方面相比单智能体方法带来了非平凡改进。

Conclusion: 通过将多智能体辩论重构为协作性非零和博弈，ColMAD协议有效缓解了辩论黑客问题，显著提升了错误检测性能，为可扩展监督提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了隐式神经表示（INRs）在压缩血流动力学场和表示心血管解剖结构方面的性能，通过多种策略缓解频谱偏差，在真实血流动力学场中实现了高达约230的压缩比，在48个胸主动脉解剖结构中平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5mm和1.6mm。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示作为一种强大的知识表示框架，在特定领域应用中的准确性尚未得到充分理解，因此需要评估其在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面的性能。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专门的激活函数、固定和可训练的位置编码以及非线性核的线性组合，评估了INRs在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面的表现。

Result: 在胸主动脉真实血流动力学场中，INRs实现了约230的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差为1 mmHg，速度误差为5-10 cm/s；在48个胸主动脉解剖结构中，平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5mm和1.6mm。

Conclusion: SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳，INRs在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面具有显著优势，提供了高压缩比和低误差的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于金属有机框架（MOF）的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体表示学习和语言理解，在材料属性预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的先进闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现领域突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多模态表示。MOF材料设计尤其具有挑战性，其三维原子排列和配位几何的复杂性难以用纯语言表示捕捉。

Method: L2M3OF整合了结构、文本和知识模态，使用预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层将结构信息压缩到token空间，与语言指令高效对齐。构建了结构-属性-知识数据库进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验显示L2M3OF在属性预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等先进的闭源文本LLM，且使用的参数数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Motivation: 大语言模型通常需要大量计算资源和内存进行推理，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法来平衡模型尺寸和精度。

Method: 采用分组格向量量化框架，为每组权重分配可学习生成矩阵定义的定制化格码本，使用Babai舍入来近似最近格点搜索以解决量化过程的不可微问题。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架提供了一种高效实用的量化流水线，解码过程简化为简单的矩阵向量乘法，在资源受限环境下有效部署大模型方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the

optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

TL;DR: 本文重新探讨了增强拉格朗日方法在非凸机器学习约束问题中的应用，建立了强对偶性结果，证明了双上升算法的收敛性，并提供了泛化保证，在公平约束分类任务中展示了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代机器学习参数化大多是非凸的，拉格朗日对偶已成为处理约束学习问题的流行工具。增强拉格朗日方法旨在缓解非凸设置中的对偶间隙，同时只需最小修改，但在约束学习设置中相对未被充分探索。

Conclusion: 增强拉格朗日方法在非凸机器学习约束问题中具有良好性能，能够有效处理对偶间隙问题，并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained
learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to
mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD方法，在信念近似精度和决策质量方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，现有POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂的不确定性结构，导致估计误差和次优的智能体行为。

Method: ESCORT扩展了SVGD，引入两个关键创新：建模状态维度间依赖关系的相关感知投影，以及稳定更新同时保持相关结构的时间一致性约束，保留了SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学。

Result: 在POMDP领域和不同维度的合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观的复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为高维复杂信念空间提供了有效的表示方法。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了零阶优化在持续学习中的应用，发现零阶优化能通过产生更平坦的损失景观来减少遗忘，但会降低学习新任务的能力。作者提出ZO-FC方法，结合零阶优化的稳定性和一阶优化的适应性，实现内存高效的持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中可塑性-稳定性-效率三难问题的新方法，利用其内存效率优势，并研究其在减少遗忘方面的潜力。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究评估零阶优化在各种持续学习方法中的应用，并提出ZO-FC方法：对单个基于适配器的PEFT模块使用零阶优化，同时对分类器使用一阶优化。

Result: 零阶优化能增强稳定性但会削弱可塑性，特别是在可学习分类器的情况下。ZO-FC方法在稳定性和可塑性之间实现了有效平衡，为设备端持续学习提供了实用的内存高效解决方案。

Conclusion: 零阶优化是持续学习中有前景的方法，通过适当的混合设计（如ZO-FC）可以平衡稳定性和可塑性，为内存受限环境下的持续学习提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Conclusion: 关键词检测是脑机接口的一个可行且实用的中间任务，具有可预测的扩展性和系统性的影响因素，为研究社区提供了标准化基准和工具支持。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Conclusion: A-GPS提供了一种简单而强大的方法，能够高效生成帕累托集近似，灵活捕捉用户偏好，避免了复杂的超体积计算，在多目标优化任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,

as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed

mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证了电网级建模的优越性，在中国多个城市的部署中显著减少了潜在损失，为电网运行提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: SolarBoost成功解决了分布式光伏系统功率输出预测的关键挑战，通过创新的电网级建模方法实现了准确预测，在实际部署中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

*Yuhao Fu,Yinghao Zhang,Yalin Liu,Bishenghui Tao,Junhong Ruan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DDPG的两层调度框架，用于在异构云-雾-边缘基础设施上调度医疗物联网中的顺序工作流，以最小化工作流完成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗物联网对顺序医疗工作流有严格的端到端延迟要求，而在异构云-雾-边缘基础设施上调度这些顺序工作流以最小化完成时间是一个NP难问题。

Method: 采用两层DDPG调度框架，将调度决策分解为分层过程：全局控制器执行层选择（边缘、雾或云），专门的本地控制器处理选定层内的节点分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着工作流复杂度的增加，该方法相比基线方法表现出越来越优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，这对于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景至关重要。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架为经典和鲁棒聚类提供了统一的数学基础，l1,2范数的引入有效提升了聚类方法对异常值的鲁棒性，所提算法具有理论收敛保证。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过添加额外的损失函数来引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，从而在期望奖励和不良输出概率之间实现更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，但减少不良输出概率的方法通常会牺牲平均性能。为了改善这种权衡关系，需要一种更好的训练方法。

Method: RePULSe在标准RL损失的基础上增加了一个额外的损失函数，使用学习到的提议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明，与标准RL对齐方法和替代方案相比，RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe方法能够有效改善语言模型对齐中的权衡问题，在保持期望奖励的同时更好地控制不良输出的概率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可视化大数据系统，用于处理气象数据并执行预测任务，系统通过收集开放数据并存储在NoSQL数据库中，使用单变量、多变量方法以及基于邻近站点数据的预测方法，获得了良好的预测性能和可用性评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气象领域产生大量数据，具有高容量、高维度、缺失值频繁和变量间高度相关等特点，需要利用大数据和数据挖掘技术来处理这些数据并从中提取有用知识，以预测天气现象。

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型遗忘方法，通过擦除和修复两个阶段来清除模型对敏感信息的记忆，无需昂贵的额外微调即可实现模型净化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，导致隐私泄露风险，需要一种无需重新训练的安全净化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 重置模型最后层特定神经元以破坏细粒度信息记忆；2) 在避免记忆敏感信息的情况下微调模型。

Result: 仅需少量遗忘训练轮次，模型即可被净化，信息泄露数量显著减少。

Conclusion: SANI为医院等行业提供了一种实用的模型净化方案，可在共享前有效清除敏感信息记忆。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

TL;DR: PLAN是一个持续学习框架，通过扩展LoRA技术，使用正交基向量管理任务特定子空间，并通过基于扰动的策略优化基向量分配，以减少与已学习参数的冲突，从而在持续学习中实现高效且干扰感知的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习要求模型在适应新任务时不遗忘过去的知识。现有方法在管理任务特定子空间和减少干扰方面存在不足，因此需要开发能够主动管理子空间分配并最小化冲突的框架。

Method: PLAN扩展了LoRA技术，引入正交基向量为每个任务分配特定子空间，并通过基于扰动的策略优化基向量。此外，PLAN包含一种新颖的选择机制，识别并分配对干扰敏感的基向量，以减少对过去知识的损害。

Result: 在标准持续学习基准测试中，PLAN始终优于现有方法，为基于基础模型的持续学习建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PLAN通过主动管理任务特定子空间和优化基向量分配，在持续学习中实现了高效且干扰感知的微调，显著提升了模型性能并减少了知识遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GenReview数据集，这是迄今为止最大的包含LLM撰写评审的数据集，包含81K条通过不同提示生成的评审，用于研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在科学同行评审中的潜在应用日益增多，需要全面数据集来理解LLM部署的效用和影响，此前缺乏这样的数据集。

Method: 创建GenReview数据集，为2018-2025年ICLR会议的所有提交生成81K条LLM评审，使用负面、正面和中性三种独立提示，并将这些评审与原始论文及其评审关联。

Result: 通过GenReview数据集研究发现：LLM在评审中存在偏见；LLM撰写的评审目前可以自动检测；LLM并不总能严格遵循评审指南；LLM提供的评分仅与论文接受决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview数据集填补了相关研究空白，为深入探索LLM在科学同行评审中的影响提供了宝贵资源，揭示了LLM在评审过程中的局限性和潜在问题。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

TL;DR: FairImagen是一个后处理去偏框架，通过处理提示词嵌入来减少文本到图像扩散模型中的社会偏见，无需重新训练或修改底层模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口属性方面，需要一种无需重新训练的去偏方法。

Method: 使用公平主成分分析将CLIP输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息的子空间，结合经验噪声注入和统一跨人口投影方法实现多属性同时去偏。

Result: 在性别、种族和交叉设置上的广泛实验表明，FairImagen显著提高了公平性，在图像质量和提示词保真度方面有适度权衡，优于现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: FairImagen提供了一个简单、可扩展且模型无关的解决方案，用于实现公平的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对表格基础模型的性能至关重要，Mitra通过优化的先验混合策略实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在少样本场景（低至8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法，仅使用基线方法一半的样本及其对应的反事实解释即可提升性能。

Conclusion: CoD方法通过系统性地注入反事实解释，有效解决了少样本任务感知知识蒸馏的挑战，为资源受限场景下的模型部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Result: 实验证明FDAs在模型融合中有效，且与参数空间模型融合方法互补。

Conclusion: FDAs框架为模型融合提供了新的视角，连接了联合多任务训练和后验融合，兼具鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图注意力在学习全局交互时面临节点数量过多的问题，导致出现过度聚合现象——大量消息被不加区分地聚合到单个节点中，造成关键信息稀释和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Wideformer方法：1）将节点聚合划分为并行过程，限制每次聚合的输入量；2）通过排序和加权步骤指导模型关注特定的聚合子集，优先处理信息丰富的消息。

Result: 评估表明Wideformer能有效缓解过度聚合问题，使骨干方法能够专注于信息丰富的消息，相比基线方法获得更优性能。

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和选择性关注机制，成功解决了图注意力中的过度聚合问题，为图学习任务提供了有效的即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

*Sukanya Patra,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时自适应框架，通过在测试时收集证据来更新在受污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出，解决现实数据集中存在未检测或错误标记异常导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据集通常包含未检测或错误标记的异常，导致无监督异常检测方法性能显著下降。现有解决方案需要访问训练管道、数据或异常比例的先验知识，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，将受污染数据集训练的AD模型的先验知识与从多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典AD方法或领域特定知识获得的证据相结合，在测试时更新模型输出。

Result: 在8个视觉AD数据集、26个表格AD数据集和1个真实工业AD数据集上验证了有效性，并通过消融研究分析了超参数影响和对不同污染水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD展示了跨不同AD模型和证据对的多样性和鲁棒性，为解决现实世界异常检测中的污染数据问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Motivation: 虽然多重性（存在性能相当的不同模型）近年来受到关注，但以往研究主要关注建模选择，而数据在塑造多重性中的关键作用被相对忽视。本文旨在通过相邻数据集框架，研究单个数据点差异对多重性的影响。

Method: 引入相邻数据集框架来研究单个数据点差异对多重性的影响，通过严格的数学证明验证发现。然后将该框架扩展到主动学习和数据插补领域，提出多重性感知的数据获取策略和插补技术。

Result: 发现相邻数据集在类别分布重叠更大时表现出更低的多重性，这一反直觉现象通过共享Rashomon参数得到解释。在主动学习和数据插补应用中，提出的多重性感知方法能够有效处理多重性问题。

Conclusion: 数据在模型多重性中起着关键作用，相邻数据集框架为理解多重性提供了新的视角。提出的多重性感知方法在主动学习和数据插补中具有实际应用价值，为处理模型不确定性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法来解决多臂老虎机中的公平性问题，通过结合初始均匀探索和标准UCB算法，实现了对Nash后悔度和其他p-均值后悔度的（近似）最优控制，且仅需较弱的假设条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂老虎机的后悔度度量未能充分考虑奖励分配的公平性，特别是在需要公平分配奖励的场景中（如临床试验）。现有的Nash后悔度方法需要强假设和专门算法设计，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界（UCB）算法的组合方法，仅依赖加性Hoeffding界，可自然扩展到亚高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该方法实现了近乎最优的Nash后悔度，并能推广到更广泛的p-均值后悔度类别，在所有p值上均获得（近似）最优后悔度界。

Conclusion: 提出的简单算法框架在弱假设下解决了多臂老虎机中的公平性问题，相比现有方法具有更好的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分析自适应优化器（如Adam和Muon）在浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，揭示了低精度训练保持有效性的理论原因，并发现Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon具有更强的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展使得低精度训练对于减少内存、提高效率至关重要，但现有收敛理论假设所有组件都是精确的，忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释为什么低精度训练仍然有效。

Method: 引入首个分析自适应优化器在梯度、权重和优化器状态浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，在标准随机梯度假设下推导光滑非凸目标的收敛率，明确量化不同组件的量化误差如何影响收敛。

Result: 分析表明，只要尾数长度与迭代次数成对数比例缩放，两种算法都能保持接近全精度对应物的收敛率。Adam由于依赖β₂→1而对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，Muon需要更弱的误差控制因而更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果缩小了低精度训练方法的经验成功与理论理解之间的差距，在合成和真实数据上的数值实验证实了理论分析。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

TL;DR: ScoreNF：一种基于归一化流架构的评分学习框架，结合独立Metropolis-Hastings模块，能够从非归一化目标分布中进行高效无偏采样，减少对MCMC生成训练数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采样方法如MCMC存在收敛慢、临界减速、模式混合差和高自相关等问题，而基于似然和对抗的机器学习模型需要大量数据且易出现模式覆盖和模式崩溃问题。

Method: 提出ScoreNF框架，基于归一化流架构构建评分学习，集成独立Metropolis-Hastings模块，并开发了评估模式覆盖和模式崩溃行为的方法。

Result: 在合成2D分布（MOG-4和MOG-8）和高维φ4晶格场理论分布上验证了方法的有效性，即使在小训练集下也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: ScoreNF为从非归一化分布中采样提供了一种高效且无偏的方法，显著减少了对计算昂贵的MCMC训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超人类模型日益复杂，人类可能无法准确监督其行为。虽然弱模型可以监督强模型，但简单的弱到强泛化在分布偏移下会失效，导致强模型性能不如弱监督者。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数，自动识别可信赖的监督源。

Result: RAVEN在分布外任务上比替代基线方法性能提升超过30%，在分布内任务上匹配或超越现有方法，并能自动为更准确的弱模型分配更高权重。

Conclusion: RAVEN有效解决了弱到强泛化在分布偏移下的失效问题，证明了动态组合弱监督的鲁棒性，为复杂模型的监督提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，新提出的重参数化方法在泛化能力方面优于传统的LoRA方法，特别是在高维分类任务和LLM微调场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 新提出的重参数化方法为迁移学习提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够显著提升微调模型的泛化性能，在理论和实践中均表现出优越性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

TL;DR: C-MCTD通过引入三个互补组件，将规划从单个轨迹优化提升到完整计划组合的推理，解决了MCTD在训练轨迹长度和局部规划限制方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD虽然结合了扩散模型和树搜索进行轨迹探索，但受限于训练轨迹长度，且规划过程缺乏全局上下文，只能进行局部搜索。

Method: 提出C-MCTD框架，包含三个组件：在线组合器进行全局感知规划，分布式组合器通过并行探索降低搜索复杂度，预规划组合器利用缓存计划图加速推理。

Conclusion: C-MCTD通过组合式方法显著提升了规划能力，从单个轨迹优化扩展到完整计划组合推理，解决了MCTD的关键局限性。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦表示学习方法严重依赖因子特定的策略（目标函数或模型架构），当遇到不符合先前假设的新因子或多个因子共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，造成显著开销。

Method: 提出组合性偏置作为模块化归纳偏置，与目标和架构解耦。通过因子特定的混合策略随机重混合潜在变量，并采用两个互补目标：确保每个重混合解码为真实图像的先验损失，以及对齐复合图像与对应复合潜在变量的组合一致性损失。

Result: 实验表明该方法在属性和对象解耦方面具有竞争力，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解耦。

Conclusion: 该框架通过简单调整混合策略即可实现属性、对象甚至两者的解耦，无需修改目标或架构，为解耦表示学习提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假设的可访问计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法如决策变换器(DT)存在令牌冗余和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发UTR表示法，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单一令牌；基于此构建UDT（Transformer架构）和UDC（门控CNN架构）两个变体。

Conclusion: UTR方法在不同架构上泛化良好，为未来大规模决策模型的可扩展控制提供了高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都至关重要。用户上传的照片往往是为了强化或证明他们对物品的评价，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最有效的解释方式。

Conclusion: 通过学习预测用户可能拍摄的照片，推荐系统能够提供更有说服力的解释，提高系统可靠性，同时帮助企业了解客户关注的产品特性。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

*Tanmay Devale,Pramith Devulapalli,Steve Hanneke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了分布集合在{0,1}^ℕ上的均值一致估计问题，引入了UME-可学习性概念，证明了均值向量可分性是UME-可学习的充分条件但非必要条件，并解决了关于UME-可学习集合可数并的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Vapnik和Chervonenkis(1971)关于经验均值估计器的一致收敛框架，研究任意估计器的一致均值估计能力，即UME-可学习性。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分性条件，并通过构造非可分但UME-可学习的分布集合来验证条件。

Result: 证明了均值向量可分性是UME-可学习的充分条件但非必要条件，并建立了UME-可学习集合的可数并也是UME-可学习的。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了经典的一致收敛理论，引入了更一般的UME-可学习性概念，解决了相关猜想，为分布集合的均值估计理论提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

### [161] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在训练中使用探针作为监控工具时可能出现的Goodhart定律问题，提出了基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的两种方法，发现在偏好优化中探针检测性意外地保持得更好，且探针多样性益处有限，重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针能检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），这些行为难以仅从输出中识别。但当探针成为训练目标时，可能变得不可靠（Goodhart定律），因此需要研究如何在训练中使用探针同时保持其可靠性。

Method: 提出两种基于探针的训练方法：监督微调和直接偏好优化。在毒性减少测试平台上进行实验，评估训练后探针准确性的下降程度。尝试三种策略来保持探针检测器准确性：训练对抗探针集合、保留未用于训练的探针、训练后重新训练新探针。

Result: 1. 基于探针的偏好优化比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针可检测性，表明偏好学习目标激励维持而非模糊相关表示；2. 探针多样性提供的实际益处有限，优化后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练对于某些对齐方法是可行的，当重新训练可行时，探针集合在很大程度上是不必要的。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过在正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，显著减少了标签噪声，实现了有效的对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督视频异常检测（WSVAD）模型容易受到对抗攻击的限制，而由于弱监督的固有约束（仅提供视频级标签但需要帧级预测），传统的对抗防御机制（如对抗训练）效果不佳。

Method: 引入时空区域扭曲（SRD）方法生成伪异常，通过对正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些合成异常与噪声伪标签结合进行对抗训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提高了WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比最先进方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效减少了伪标签的噪声，实现了高效的对抗训练，显著提升了弱监督视频异常检测模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

*Nikolai Gruzinov,Ksenia Sycheva,Earl T. Barr,Alex Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了修订相似性问题，并指出传统相似性度量方法（如BLEU）因过度关注共享内容而无法准确评估文档修订。作者提出了一种新的静态度量方法——切除评分（ES），通过移除现有文档与修订版本之间的共享内容，专注于比较差异区域，从而更好地与人类判断保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档修订评估方法（如BLEU）存在根本性缺陷，其评分过度受共享内容主导，导致在人类认为修订差异很大时仍报告高相似性。这促使研究者开发能更好反映人类判断的修订相似性度量方法。

Method: 提出切除评分（ES）方法：首先使用最长公共子序列（LCS）移除现有文档与真实修订和预测修订之间的共享内容，然后仅比较剩余的差异区域。通过近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次复杂度。

Result: 在代码编辑评估中，ES显著优于现有度量方法。在HumanEvalFix数据集上，ES与测试执行的Pearson相关性比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%，比标准度量方法（如BLEU）提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES的改进进一步增加到20%（相比SARI）和>30%（相比标准度量）。

Conclusion: ES方法通过专注于修订的差异区域而非共享内容，有效解决了传统相似性度量的根本缺陷，在多个评估场景中表现出与人类判断更好的一致性，并能正确处理代码块移动、插入删除等复杂情况。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为生成相关流形（GCM）的计算高效方法，通过Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据，数学上保证保留源数据集的完整相关结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法通常只能复制简单的汇总统计量，但无法保留数据的成对和高阶相关结构，这导致生成的合成数据在复杂建模任务中表现不佳。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据集，该方法数学上保证能够保留从简单成对关系到高阶交互的完整相关结构。

Result: GCM方法能够生成保留源数据集完整相关结构的合成数据，包括成对和高阶相关性。

Conclusion: GCM为合成数据生成提供了一种新方法，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

TL;DR: ZETA是一个零样本多模态框架，用于可解释的心电图诊断，通过比较ECG信号与结构化临床观察来模拟鉴别诊断过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动ECG诊断系统在透明性和泛化到未见情况方面存在困难，需要更符合临床工作流程的可解释诊断方法。

Method: 使用预训练多模态模型对齐ECG和文本嵌入，无需疾病特定微调；通过LLM辅助、专家验证的过程构建结构化正负临床观察数据集。

Result: 实证评估显示ZETA在零样本分类性能上具有竞争力，并提供定性和定量证据证明其增强的可解释性，将预测基于具体的临床相关诊断特征。

Conclusion: ZETA展示了将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐的潜力，可构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

TL;DR: DEEDEE是一个用于强化学习时间序列的OOD检测器，采用双统计量方法，仅使用情节均值和RBF核相似度来捕捉全局和局部偏差，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要开发高效的OOD检测方法。

Method: 提出DEEDEE检测器，使用情节均值和RBF核相似度这两个统计量，分别捕捉全局和局部偏差，采用轻量级设计避免复杂的表示学习。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD测试套件中表现优异，计算量减少600倍（FLOPs/时间），平均准确率比强基线提高5%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，多样异常类型通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: REVE是一个专门为处理多样化EEG信号设计的预训练模型，通过创新的4D位置编码方案处理任意长度和电极排列的信号，在92个数据集上预训练超过60,000小时，在10个下游EEG任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以泛化到不同协议、设备和电极配置的异构数据集，通常限制在单一设置下预训练，导致性能不佳，特别是在线性探测下表现不理想。

Method: 引入新颖的4D位置编码方案，使用掩码自编码目标在92个数据集超过25,000名受试者的60,000多小时EEG数据上进行预训练。

Conclusion: REVE支持标准化EEG研究并加速临床神经科学进展，通过发布代码、预训练权重和教程来促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HOPSS的新数据生成算法，通过同源扰动方法直接从少量时间步生成训练数据集，显著降低了非线性时间偏微分方程数据生成的计算和时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，远超过训练所需的几十个时间步，造成沉重的计算和时间开销。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数，通过下采样对齐时间步；然后提出"同源扰动"方法：将两个解函数（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，高效生成具有可比精度的PDE数据点；最后用这些数据点计算原方程右端项的变化来形成新的解对。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度。例如，在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够同时加速数据集生成并保持模型训练所需的近似精度，为非线性时间偏微分方程的数据驱动求解提供了高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Conclusion: GFM框架为几何数据生成提供了一种计算高效的少步生成方法，统一了现有的欧几里得少步生成模型，并在黎曼流形上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

TL;DR: 本文建立了Popularity-Adjusted Block Model（PABM）下图聚类理论极限，证明PABM能捕捉DCBM忽略的度异质性维度，即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型（如SBM和DCBM）的局限性，SBM假设顶点度均匀，DCBM在簇间应用统一度校正，而PABM引入了簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数。

Method: 在PABM下建立图聚类的理论极限，分析谱嵌入方法，比较使用前k个和前k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法性能。

Result: 证明了PABM中聚类恢复的可行性条件，发现基于前k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法在合成和真实数据集上优于传统谱方法。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉了DCBM忽略的度异质性重要维度，局部连接模式差异可独立于全局边密度增强簇可分离性，需要更丰富的谱嵌入来捕获PABM结构信息。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖特定群结构的归纳偏置来学习等变表示，本文旨在开发一种通用方法，仅从群作用观察中学习等变嵌入，无需先验群知识。

Method: 提出Equivariance by Contrast (EbC)方法，联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应可逆线性映射，使用对比学习从观察对(y, g·y)中学习。

Result: 在无限dSprites数据集上验证了方法有效性，实现了高保真等变性，群操作在潜在空间中忠实再现，并在非阿贝尔正交群和一般线性群上进一步验证。

Conclusion: 这是首个仅从群作用观察中成功实现通用编码器等变学习的方法，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和乘积群，为计算机视觉中的仿射等变性建模提供了基础。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

### [172] [Fuzzy numbers revisited: operations on extensional fuzzy numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20861)
*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模糊数表示方法——外延模糊数，定义了其运算和关系运算符，解决了传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂性和结果特征不一致等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在计算复杂度高、运算结果不保持原始特征（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不是三角模糊数）、模糊扩散等问题，限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 提出外延模糊数的概念，定义其运算规则和关系运算符（=, >, >=, <, <=），并通过应用实例进行验证，提供了C++实现。

Result: 外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算的问题，降低了计算复杂度，保持了运算结果的特性一致性。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效、更实用的替代方案，扩展了模糊数在实践中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

### [173] [Understanding AI Trustworthiness: A Scoping Review of AIES & FAccT Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21293)
*Siddharth Mehrotra,Jin Huang,Xuelong Fu,Roel Dobbe,Clara I. Sánchez,Maarten de Rijke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过范围综述分析了AIES和FAccT会议中关于可信AI的研究现状，发现当前研究过度关注技术属性而忽视社会技术维度，提出了结合技术严谨性与社会文化考量的跨学科方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要采用技术中心方法，重点关注可靠性、鲁棒性和公平性等技术属性，而忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度在不同研究领域中的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现在定义透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性方面取得了显著进展，但存在关键差距：当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会和伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的有争议概念。

Conclusion: 结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法对于推进可信AI至关重要。作者为AI伦理社区提出了可操作措施，以采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架，最终促进惠及所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

### [174] [Epistemic Deference to AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21043)
*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了何时应该优先采用AI输出而非人类专家判断的问题，提出了AI优先主义观点及其替代方案——总体证据观点，认为AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于社会认识论的研究，探讨AI系统作为人工认识权威的资格，以及何时应该优先采用AI输出而非人类专家判断，旨在为AI信任提供原则性指导。

Method: 通过分析AI优先主义观点及其经典反对意见，发展出总体证据观点作为替代方案，强调AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类认知。

Result: 总体证据观点具有三个关键优势：缓解专业知识萎缩、为人机协作提供认识论依据、解释在可靠性条件未满足时对AI的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 总体证据观点为确定何时应该信任AI提供了原则性方法，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险环境中，尽管在实践中要求较高。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

### [175] [From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045)
*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个多智能体框架，将自然语言问题准确翻译为空间SQL查询，通过专业智能体协作和程序化验证提高准确性，在空间查询上达到87.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SQL和PostGIS等地理空间函数的复杂性对非专家用户造成的障碍，克服单智能体方法在处理空间查询语义和语法复杂性时的局限性。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括知识库、程序化模式分析和语义增强、上下文检索嵌入、协作多智能体流水线（实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成）以及执行程序化和语义验证的审查智能体。

Result: 在非空间KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%准确率，在空间查询上达到87.7%准确率（相比无审查智能体的76.7%），且在某些情况下生成的查询比基准测试中的查询更符合用户意图。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

### [176] [MedAlign: A Synergistic Framework of Multimodal Preference Optimization and Federated Meta-Cognitive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21093)
*Siyong Chen,Jinbo Wen,Jiawen Kang,Tenghui Huang,Xumin Huang,Yuanjia Su,Hudan Pan,Zishao Zhong,Dusit Niyato,Shengli Xie,Dong In Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个针对医学视觉问答任务的新框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知的专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在临床部署中的幻觉问题、固定深度推理效率低和多机构协作困难等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在智能医疗领域有巨大潜力，但面临三个关键挑战：幻觉回答、固定深度推理效率低、多机构协作困难，阻碍了其在临床服务中的部署。

Method: 1. 多模态直接偏好优化目标，将偏好学习与视觉上下文对齐；2. 检索感知的专家混合架构，利用图像和文本相似性将查询路由到专门的上下文增强专家模型；3. 联邦治理机制，通过本地元认知不确定性估计器实现自适应迭代思维链推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上的实验表明，MedAlign实现了最先进的性能，比强检索增强基线在F1分数上高出11.85%，同时与固定深度CoT方法相比平均推理长度减少了51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign通过创新的多模态对齐、专家路由和联邦治理机制，有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，为临床服务部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

### [177] [NeuroGenPoisoning: Neuron-Guided Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation of LLM via Genetic Optimization of External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21144)
*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过分析LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化，生成对抗性外部知识来毒化RAG系统，有效解决知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法主要操纵检索内容或提示结构，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突机制。

Method: 首先识别与上下文毒化知识强相关的毒化响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察归因信号重用有前景但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 基于毒化响应神经元的引导毒化能有效解决知识冲突，NeuroGenPoisoning框架能够大规模生成有效的毒化RAG知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

### [178] [How to Auto-optimize Prompts for Domain Tasks? Adaptive Prompting and Reasoning through Evolutionary Domain Knowledge Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21148)
*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化框架，通过进化图优化方法为领域特定任务设计更好的提示和推理过程，提升LLM性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为大型语言模型设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程是必要但具有挑战性的。如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合提示是尚未解决的关键问题。

Method: EGO-Prompt从专家构建的通用提示和容错语义因果图开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程自动优化：首先生成确定性推理指导，然后使LLM能够有效利用该指导与原始输入。迭代优化算法使用基于真实数据的文本梯度进一步优化语义因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为等真实世界任务中，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法实现7.32%-12.61%的F1分数提升，并使小模型以不到20%的原始成本达到大模型的性能水平。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt框架能够自动优化提示和推理过程，显著提升LLM在领域特定任务中的性能，同时输出经过优化的领域特定语义因果图以提高可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [179] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来选择答案，显著改善了LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要从预定义选项集合中按特定概率分布选择答案的概率指令跟随任务中表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏等应用，也损害了测试时扩展所需的响应多样性。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出一个随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLM的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能；在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的偏见问题，提高输出多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级无内存的持续学习框架，通过低秩适应和约束任务特定权重更新到模型参数的近似零空间，来保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，同时实现持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法在不遗忘旧知识的情况下适应新环境。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架不仅有效保护零样本迁移能力，还在持续学习基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实世界应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在三个关键限制：数据集多样性和类别覆盖不足、用户模拟不真实、评估指标不准确，需要开发更全面的评估框架来测试LLMs在专业外呼场景中的能力。

Method: 设计覆盖6个主要业务领域和30个子场景的基准测试，采用大模型驱动的用户模拟器生成多样化虚拟用户，引入动态评估方法结合自动化和人工评估，测量任务执行准确性、专业知识应用、适应性和用户体验质量。

Conclusion: OutboundEval为在专业应用中基准测试LLMs建立了实用、可扩展和面向领域的新标准。

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

TL;DR: 本文对自主系统中的OOD检测技术进行了全面综述，重点分析了其在安全关键领域的安全保证应用，探讨了OOD的成因、挑战因素，并提出了在整个ML开发生命周期中使用的技术方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，如何严格证明其安全性成为关键挑战。OOD检测能够处理系统生命周期中的新颖和不确定情况，对安全保证至关重要，因此需要系统性的技术综述。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，首先定义相关概念，分析OOD产生原因和挑战因素，然后识别在整个ML开发生命周期中可用的OOD检测技术，并建议其在安全保证论证中的适用阶段。

Result: 识别了一系列可在ML开发生命周期不同阶段使用的OOD检测技术，讨论了系统工程师在集成OOD检测时需要注意的注意事项，为自主系统的安全开发提供了技术框架。

Conclusion: 总结了自主系统安全开发和运行面临的挑战，并指出了未来需要进一步研究的方向，以支持跨领域和应用的自主系统安全部署。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [183] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了多种自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略，推荐使用新提出的λ=2σ方法，其中σ是搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差，该方法在不同任务中表现优于现有策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度不鲁棒，在具有密集奖励的游戏中使用固定探索常数会导致性能问题，需要开发对奖励尺度鲁棒的自适应λ选择策略。

Method: 评估文献中已有的λ策略，并提出了五种新策略，包括基于Q值经验标准差的λ=2σ方法，在不同任务上进行实验比较。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务范围内表现最佳，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ作为UCT算法的自适应探索常数选择策略，该方法对游戏奖励尺度鲁棒且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，显著优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架通过系统性解决推理过程中的安全问题，有效平衡了大型推理模型的安全性与推理能力，为解决安全-推理权衡提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过符号验证和交互验证过程增强代码生成的环境基础，在动态或部分可观察环境中显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观察环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致任务成功率较低。

Method: 结合显式符号验证和交互验证过程，在验证阶段生成探索性代码主动与环境交互获取缺失观察，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观察场景中，任务成功率比代码即策略基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强生成代码的环境基础，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

*Jinhui Lou,Yan Yang,Zhou Yu,Zhenqi Fu,Weidong Han,Qingming Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了CXRAgent，一个由导演协调的多阶段智能体，用于胸部X光片（CXR）解读。该智能体通过工具调用、诊断规划和协作决策三个阶段的协调工作，结合证据驱动的验证器和专家团队协作，提高了CXR分析的适应性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，且现有智能体通常依赖单一诊断流程，缺乏工具可靠性评估机制，限制了其适应性和可信度。

Method: 提出CXRAgent框架，包含三个协调阶段：1）工具调用阶段，通过证据驱动验证器对工具输出进行归一化和验证；2）诊断规划阶段，根据任务需求和中间发现制定针对性诊断计划并组建专家团队；3）协作决策阶段，整合专家团队见解和上下文记忆，生成基于证据的诊断结论。

Result: 在各种CXR解读任务上的实验表明，CXRAgent表现出强大的性能，能够提供视觉证据，并能很好地泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协调和证据驱动的验证机制，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性和可信度，为自动CXR解读提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

### [187] [Magellan: Guided MCTS for Latent Space Exploration and Novelty Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21341)
*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan是一个基于蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)的创新生成框架，通过语义罗盘和景观感知价值函数指导LLM在概念空间中进行有原则的探索，显著提升了科学创意的可信度和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在生成真正创新想法时往往局限于训练数据中的高概率概念，现有方法如思维树(ToT)依赖不可靠的自我评估启发式方法，存在根本性限制。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)框架，结合分层引导系统：语义罗盘通过正交投影提供长程方向指导，景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自我评估，平衡内在连贯性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 大量实验表明，Magellan在生成科学想法方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线方法，在可信度和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，有原则的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLMs成为创新合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

### [188] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，用于在无法明确定义失败状态集的情况下保证自主系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全性是基本要求。传统控制屏障函数需要明确定义失败状态集，但在实际应用中（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题），失败状态集往往难以明确定义，而专家演示数据更容易获得。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后利用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹数据来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，结果表明该方法优于现有基线方法，并且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的替代方案，能够在无法明确定义失败状态集的情况下有效保证系统安全性。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

*Ankur Sinha,Shobhit Arora,Dhaval Pujara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，配套开发了AutoOpt框架，通过深度学习模型自动识别优化问题图像并求解，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工建模和编程的繁琐过程，开发一个能够直接从图像自动识别并求解优化问题的自动化框架。

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: M1模块在BLEU评分上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；M3模块在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好；数据集经过两阶段验证确保质量。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架和AutoOpt-11k数据集为自动化优化问题求解提供了有效的解决方案，在数学表达式识别和复杂优化问题求解方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

### [190] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。该方法在三个生物医学任务中表现出色，在类别选择和映射质量方面均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完整地语境化到特定领域。虽然简单的成对本体匹配技术已经很成熟，但简单的等价映射无法提供相关但不相交的本体的完整语义集成。复杂多本体匹配能够将一个源实体与多个目标实体的复合逻辑表达式对齐，建立更细致的等价关系和本体层次上的溯源。

Method: CMOMgen采用检索增强生成方法，选择相关类别来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例，以增强上下文学习。这是首个端到端的CMOM策略，不限制目标本体或实体的数量。

Result: 在三个具有部分参考对齐的生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类别选择方面优于基线方法。在两个任务中F1分数至少达到63%，优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。对非参考映射的手动评估显示，46%的映射获得了最高分，进一步证实了其构建语义合理映射的能力。

Conclusion: CMOMgen是复杂多本体匹配的有效策略，能够生成高质量、语义合理的映射，在生物医学领域的本体集成任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态基准数据集，专门用于分析能源公司公关视频中的框架类型，特别是检测"漂绿"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业经常投入大量资金进行公关活动来塑造正面品牌形象，但有时存在言行不一的问题。能源公司被指控使用气候友好倡议的意象进行"漂绿"。理解大规模框架及其变化有助于更好地理解公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建了一个专家标注的视频广告数据集，从Facebook和YouTube获取，包含13种框架类型的标注，涵盖20个国家的50多家公司或倡导团体。该数据集专门设计用于评估视觉语言模型。

Result: 基线实验显示有希望的结果：GPT-4.1能以79%的F1分数检测环境信息，而最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46%的F1分数。研究还识别了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集为能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究做出了贡献，揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐性框架、不同长度视频和隐性文化背景等方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主智能体协调中高层任务语义与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟，使复杂协调路径能够通过简单修改知识图谱中的事实来实现。

Method: 引入以知识图谱为中心的框架，采用双平面架构将声明性事实编译为每个智能体的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 通过墨西哥湾自主水下航行器的案例研究，可视化展示了端到端流程，并定量证明不同声明性策略能够产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ROPES框架，通过基于分数的因果表示学习实现机器人姿态估计，无需监督数据即可从原始图像中恢复位置和方向等可控潜在变量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果表示学习在理论上有显著进展，但与实际应用存在差距。本文旨在将CRL应用于机器人领域，特别是机器人姿态估计问题，弥合理论与实践之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出ROPES框架，利用干预性CRL理论，通过控制机器人执行器产生图像变化，识别可操纵的潜在变量。该方法仅利用分布变化，无需任何标注数据。

Result: 在半合成机械臂实验中，ROPES成功以高保真度解耦了潜在生成因子，与真实值高度一致。与最近提出的半监督基线相比表现良好。

Conclusion: 机器人姿态估计可作为因果表示学习的近乎实用的测试平台，ROPES框架展示了无监督CRL在机器人领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

Abstract: Aircraft collision avoidance systems is critical to modern aviation. These
systems are designed to predict potential collisions between aircraft and
recommend appropriate avoidance actions. Creating effective collision avoidance

overview of these challenges and solutions with an emphasis on those that have
been put through a rigorous validation process and accepted by regulatory

present in other domains, and aircraft collision avoidance systems can serve as
case studies that provide valuable insights for a wide range of safety-critical

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in

Motivation: 点云强化学习虽然能减轻基于外观的脆弱性，但对相机姿态失配的敏感性继续削弱了在实际环境中的可靠性。

Method: 提出PPC框架，将任意刚性变换下的点云映射到唯一规范姿态，使观测对齐到一致的坐标系。

Result: 实验表明PPC在具有挑战性的机器人任务中提高了对未见相机姿态的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PPC为领域随机化提供了一个原则性替代方案，显著减少了由视点引起的不一致性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Result: 在移动机械臂上进行了不同操作任务的实验，验证了系统的有效性，机器人能够成功重复演示任务。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了从人类演示到机器人操作的有效轨迹转移，使机器人具备观看一次演示后在不同环境中执行相同移动操作任务的能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文研究了两种机器人示教框架：传统整体方法和顺序方法，并提出了(ST)^2顺序学习方法。用户研究表明两种方法在轨迹质量和成功率上相似，但用户偏好不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从示教中学习对机器人技能教学有效，但教授包含多个技能的长期任务存在困难，包括偏差累积、分布偏移和教师疲劳等问题。

Method: 引入(ST)^2顺序学习方法，允许用户通过定义关键点来控制教学流程，支持增量化和结构化演示。通过16名参与者在零售环境中的用户研究，比较传统整体方法和顺序方法。

Result: 客观和主观结果显示，两种方法在轨迹质量和成功率上相似。部分参与者偏好顺序方法的迭代控制，而其他参与者则青睐整体方法的简洁性。

Conclusion: 两种示教方法在性能上相当，但用户偏好存在差异，表明应根据具体应用场景和用户需求选择合适的教学框架。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

*Mitchell E. C. Sabbadini,Andrew H. Liu,Joseph Ruan,Tyler S. Wilson,Zachary Kingston,Jonathan D. Gammell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文挑战了反应式重规划必须更新现有计划的传统假设，提出使用快速几乎必然渐近最优(ASAO)规划算法将增量规划问题转化为一系列独立问题求解，在动态环境中无需显式计划重用即可找到一致的全局路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反应式规划方法需要重用查询间信息，但在信息变化时更新密集规划图计算成本高，且在某些应用中检测变化需要大量工作。本文旨在探索更高效的增量规划替代方案。

Method: 使用快速几乎必然渐近最优(ASAO)规划算法，如Effort Informed Trees (EIT*)和Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC)，这些算法能快速找到初始解并收敛到最优解，从而在障碍物变化时无需显式计划重用即可找到一致的全局计划。

Result: 模拟实验显示EIT*找到的解决方案路径中位数比测试的反应式规划算法更短，并在机器人臂的真实世界规划问题上通过AORRTC进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 反应式重规划不一定需要更新现有计划，使用ASAO算法作为一系列独立问题求解可以更高效地处理动态环境中的规划问题，无需显式计划重用即可获得高质量的全局路径。

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

TL;DR: 开发了一种用于模块化机器人的自适应速度限制控制器，通过动态超球面钳制实现安全稳定的运动对齐，在月球环境模拟器中测试显示步进版本运动更平稳，连续版本收敛更快且精度更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模块化机器人在月球任务中需要能够适应现实世界干扰的安全控制器，确保在恶劣条件下的自主自组装和重构能力。

Method: 基于Motion Stack中的硬件无关执行器同步，开发了通过动态超球面钳制实现自适应速度限制的控制器，仅使用实时末端执行器和目标姿态测量，调整平移和旋转速度限制以确保平滑稳定对齐。实现了步进式和连续式两种变体。

Result: 在JAXA月球环境模拟器中对两个MoonBot肢体进行现场测试，步进变体产生高度可预测、低摆动的运动，连续变体收敛更快并保持毫米级位置精度，两种变体在不同机械缺陷和传感噪声下均保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该机器人无关框架在恶劣条件下具有灵活性和鲁棒性，适用于自主自组装和重构任务。

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

Motivation: 水下环境中由于能见度有限、光照不足和特征稀缺导致的视觉退化问题，严重影响了视觉-惯性SLAM系统的性能。

Method: 采用四传感器紧耦合方法，提出基于速度偏差的DVL预积分策略，在前端使用混合跟踪策略和声学-惯性-深度联合优化，并在图优化框架中融入多源混合残差。

Result: 在模拟和真实水下场景中的定量和定性分析表明，该方法在稳定性和定位精度上优于现有最先进的立体视觉-惯性SLAM系统，在视觉挑战性环境中表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该多传感器融合方法能够有效应对水下视觉退化环境，显著提升SLAM系统的可靠性和定位精度。

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

Motivation: 消费级无人机被急救人员广泛使用，但通常需要手动操作，特别是在未知的GNSS拒绝环境和结构附近需要训练有素的飞行员。自主飞行可以简化无人机应用并减轻操作员负担，但现有自主系统通常需要特殊编程接口、定制传感器设置和强大的机载计算机，限制了更广泛部署。

Method: 开发了一个系统，使用轻量级消费级DJI无人机，通过Android应用在无人机遥控器上直接运行状态估计和避障算法，地面控制站支持单操作员同时配置和监控多架异构无人机。

Result: 系统能够实现自主飞行，将多架无人机的观测数据整合成联合3D环境模型，提高了态势感知能力。

Conclusion: 该系统为消费级无人机提供了实用的自主飞行解决方案，克服了传统自主系统对特殊硬件和复杂设置的依赖，便于急救人员等用户更广泛地部署和使用。

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of
structures. Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce
operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special
programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,
which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade
DJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and
obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground
control station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple
heterogeneous UAVs at once. Furthermore, it combines the observations of all
UAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在搜救任务或行星探索中，坍塌地形对四足机器人构成重大挑战，传统方法依赖专用传感器或外部地形测绘，无法有效应对不稳定表面。

Method: 利用关节测量评估地形稳定性，无需硬件修改；采用模型预测控制(MPC)系统优化机器人运动，平衡稳定性和探测约束；通过状态机协调地形探测动作。

Result: 在定制坍塌平台和岩石地形上的实验结果表明，该框架能够在保持稳定性和优先考虑安全性的同时穿越坍塌地形。

Conclusion: 该框架为四足机器人在不稳定地形上的安全导航提供了有效的解决方案，通过集成多种技术实现了对坍塌地形的鲁棒穿越能力。

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

Conclusion: 韧性是社会机器人在敏感应用场景中建立和维持用户信任的关键因素，特别是在与老年人互动时。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现安全可靠的现实世界机器人操作需要超越视觉并整合触觉传感，以克服感官缺陷和对理想化状态信息的依赖。尽管触觉传感具有潜力，但在强化学习中的效果仍然不一致。

Method: 开发自监督学习方法，重点关注本体感觉和稀疏二元接触的可扩展设置，并将SSL记忆与策略记忆解耦。

Result: 稀疏二元触觉信号对于灵巧性至关重要，特别是在本体感觉控制错误无法检测的交互中。智能体在复杂接触任务（球弹跳和保定球旋转）中实现了超人类的灵巧度。

Conclusion: 触觉传感对于机器人灵巧操作至关重要，自监督学习方法能有效利用触觉观测，解耦SSL记忆可提升性能，并发布了RoTO基准以促进未来触觉操作研究。

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.

Abstract: This paper discusses the issue regarding Non-verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder.
It has been observed that this mental disorder is listed in major parts of the
world including the US, UK, and India. To mitigate this type of disorder, a
wide range of smartphones, computers, and artificial intelligence technologies
have been used. This technology has helped the population cope with
socialization and communication needs. Many applications have been developed to
enhance the communication capabilities of non-verbal autistic children. This
thesis project proposes the development of a platform that includes a web panel
and an Android mobile application to assist non-verbal autistic children in
communication, especially in Oman. Different interventions have been merged to
improve the quality of life for people on the autism spectrum. The main problem
identified in this case is that fragmented approaches are not suitable for
autistic children. The augmented reality framework provides the capability to
engage autistic children in creative play and self-reflection through
interactive screen-based activities.

TL;DR: VOGUE是一个新颖的多模态对话推荐数据集，包含60个真实时尚购物场景的人类对话，配有视觉目录、用户档案和评分，用于评估对话推理和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态对话推荐数据集存在局限性：要么模拟对话，要么忽略用户历史，要么缺乏详细反馈，限制了研究和评估的范围。

Method: 收集60个人类对话，每个对话配有共享视觉目录、物品元数据、用户时尚档案和历史，以及对话后评分，支持对话推理的严格评估。

Result: 分析显示视觉对话具有独特动态，推荐者常按特征分组推荐物品；MLLMs在总体对齐上接近人类水平，但在评分分布上存在系统性误差，难以将偏好推理推广到未明确讨论的物品。

Conclusion: VOGUE既是研究多模态对话系统的独特资源，也是超越当前顶级多模态基础模型推荐能力的挑战数据集。

Abstract: Multimodal conversational recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
for delivering personalized experiences through natural dialogue enriched by
visual and contextual grounding. Yet, current multimodal conversational
recommendation datasets remain limited: existing resources either simulate
conversations, omit user history, or fail to collect sufficiently detailed
feedback, all of which constrain the types of research and evaluation they
support.
  To address these gaps, we introduce VOGUE, a novel dataset of 60 humanhuman
dialogues in realistic fashion shopping scenarios. Each dialogue is paired with
a shared visual catalogue, item metadata, user fashion profiles and histories,
and post-conversation ratings from both Seekers and Assistants. This design
enables rigorous evaluation of conversational inference, including not only
alignment between predicted and ground-truth preferences, but also calibration
against full rating distributions and comparison with explicit and implicit
user satisfaction signals.
  Our initial analyses of VOGUE reveal distinctive dynamics of visually
grounded dialogue. For example, recommenders frequently suggest items
simultaneously in feature-based groups, which creates distinct conversational
phases bridged by Seeker critiques and refinements. Benchmarking multimodal
large language models against human recommenders shows that while MLLMs
approach human-level alignment in aggregate, they exhibit systematic
distribution errors in reproducing human ratings and struggle to generalize
preference inference beyond explicitly discussed items. These findings
establish VOGUE as both a unique resource for studying multimodal
conversational systems and as a challenge dataset beyond the current
recommendation capabilities of existing top-tier multimodal foundation models
such as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash.

TL;DR: BLOGER是一个用于生成式推荐的双层优化框架，通过统一优化分词器和推荐器来解决现有方法中两者分离导致的标识符与推荐目标不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法通常将分词器和推荐器的训练分开处理（顺序或交替），忽略了它们之间的相互依赖关系，导致分词器训练缺乏推荐目标的直接指导，产生次优的标识符从而降低推荐性能。

Method: 提出BLOGER框架，采用双层优化方法：下层训练推荐器使用分词后的序列，上层基于分词损失和推荐损失优化分词器。采用元学习方法高效解决双层优化问题，并引入梯度手术来缓解上层更新中的梯度冲突。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，BLOGER在保持实际效率的同时，始终优于最先进的生成式推荐方法，且没有显著增加计算开销。

Conclusion: BLOGER有效弥合了项目分词和自回归生成之间的差距，确保项目标识符既具有信息性又与推荐目标对齐。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a transformative paradigm by
directly generating recommended items, rather than relying on matching.
Building such a system typically involves two key components: (1) optimizing
the tokenizer to derive suitable item identifiers, and (2) training the
recommender based on those identifiers. Existing approaches often treat these
components separately--either sequentially or in alternation--overlooking their
interdependence. This separation can lead to misalignment: the tokenizer is
trained without direct guidance from the recommendation objective, potentially
yielding suboptimal identifiers that degrade recommendation performance.
  To address this, we propose BLOGER, a Bi-Level Optimization for GEnerative
Recommendation framework, which explicitly models the interdependence between
the tokenizer and the recommender in a unified optimization process. The lower
level trains the recommender using tokenized sequences, while the upper level
optimizes the tokenizer based on both the tokenization loss and recommendation
loss. We adopt a meta-learning approach to solve this bi-level optimization
efficiently, and introduce gradient surgery to mitigate gradient conflicts in
the upper-level updates, thereby ensuring that item identifiers are both
informative and recommendation-aligned. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BLOGER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
generative recommendation methods while maintaining practical efficiency with
no significant additional computational overhead, effectively bridging the gap
between item tokenization and autoregressive generation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种个性化上下文感知分词器，解决了生成式推荐模型中现有分词方法静态、非个性化的问题。通过将用户历史交互融入语义ID生成过程，使同一物品在不同用户上下文中能够被分词为不同的语义ID，从而提升推荐的个性化效果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐模型的分词方法都是静态和非个性化的，仅基于物品特征生成语义ID，假设存在通用的物品相似性标准。但实际上，同一物品在不同用户视角下可能有不同的解释。这种固定映射限制了模型捕捉用户个性化偏好的能力。

Method: 提出个性化上下文感知分词器，在生成语义ID时融入用户的历史交互信息。这使得同一物品在不同用户上下文中可以被分词为不同的语义ID，从而在自回归生成过程中能够基于用户特定的解释标准进行预测。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，相比非个性化动作分词基线方法，NDCG@10指标提升了最高11.44%。

Conclusion: 个性化上下文感知分词器能够有效解决生成式推荐模型中固定分词映射的限制，通过允许同一物品在不同用户上下文中具有不同的语义表示，显著提升了推荐的个性化效果和性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出CausalRec框架，通过因果注意力机制改进序列推荐系统，结合因果发现模块和CausalBooster，在真实数据集上相比现有方法平均提升7.21% HR和8.65% NDCG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相关性的序列推荐系统仅关注项目共现，忽视了用户行为背后的因果动机，导致虚假相关性和不准确推荐。

Method: CausalRec框架包含因果发现模块学习用户行为序列的因果图，并提供理论保证因果图的可识别性；CausalBooster利用发现的因果图优化注意力机制，优先考虑具有因果重要性的行为。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，CausalRec优于多种最先进方法，HR平均提升7.21%，NDCG平均提升8.65%。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过注意力机制在序列推荐中整合因果关系的模型，证明了因果关系在生成更准确可靠推荐中的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have
demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model
outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both
short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on
item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,
leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal
attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal
discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the
causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee
the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the
discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing
behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world
datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,
with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in
sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating
more accurate and reliable recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言用户档案推荐系统缺乏大规模公开测试数据集的问题，为评估基于NL档案的推荐方法提供资源。

Method: 利用作者发表历史生成自然语言档案和对应真实项目，构建SciNUP数据集，并比较稀疏检索、稠密检索和LLM重排器等基线方法。

Result: 基线方法性能相当但检索项目不同，显示互补行为；同时存在显著改进空间，突显有效NL推荐方法的需求。

Conclusion: SciNUP数据集为基于自然语言档案的推荐研究提供了有价值的资源，促进该领域未来发展。

Abstract: The use of natural language (NL) user profiles in recommender systems offers
greater transparency and user control compared to traditional representations.
However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections
for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we
introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that
leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and
corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison
of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to
state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline
methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items,
indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for
improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based
recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable
resource for fostering future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Multilingual e-commerce search suffers from severe data imbalance across
languages, label noise, and limited supervision for low-resource
languages--challenges that impede the cross-lingual generalization of relevance
models despite the strong capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we present a practical, architecture-agnostic, data-centric framework to
enhance performance on two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance (matching
queries to product categories) and Query-Item (QI) relevance (matching queries
to product titles). Rather than altering the model, we redesign the training
data through three complementary strategies: (1) translation-based augmentation
to synthesize examples for languages absent in training, (2) semantic negative
sampling to generate hard negatives and mitigate class imbalance, and (3)
self-validation filtering to detect and remove likely mislabeled instances.
Evaluated on the CIKM AnalytiCup 2025 dataset, our approach consistently yields
substantial F1 score improvements over strong LLM baselines, achieving
competitive results in the official competition. Our findings demonstrate that
systematic data engineering can be as impactful as--and often more deployable
than--complex model modifications, offering actionable guidance for building
robust multilingual search systems in the real-world e-commerce settings.
