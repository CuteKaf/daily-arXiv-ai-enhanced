Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiscover\u3001Learn\u548cReinforce\uff08DLR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6807\u51c6RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDLR\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6RL\u53ea\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "DLR\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u5f0fRL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eDLR\u591a\u6837\u5316RL\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u51c6RL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u6a21\u5f0fRL\u6240\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

With the growing complexity of modern control problems, CBFs have received increasing attention in both optimization-based and learning-based control communities as a safety filter, owing to their provable guarantees. However, success in transferring these guarantees to real-world systems is critically tied to model accuracy. For example, payloads or wind disturbances can significantly influence the dynamics of an aerial vehicle and invalidate the safety guarantee. In this work, we propose an efficient yet flexible online learning-enhanced high-order adaptive control barrier function using Neural ODEs. Our approach improves the safety of a CBF-certified system on the fly, even under complex time-varying model perturbations. In particular, we deploy our hybrid adaptive CBF controller on a 38g nano quadrotor, keeping a safe distance from the obstacle, against 18km/h wind.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecfODE\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u9636\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u572838\u514b\u7eb3\u7c73\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570(CBFs)\u662f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6216\u98ce\u6270\u52a8\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u53d8\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u539f\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94CBF\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u98de\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u572838\u514b\u7eb3\u7c73\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u572818\u516c\u91cc/\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u98ce\u901f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8CBF\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations.

First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives.

Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u548cAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u76d1\u6d4b\u6162\u6027\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u597d\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u6162\u6027\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u969c\u788d\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u76d1\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u79cdAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5206\u6790\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08>0.7\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1aLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c4\u5212\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u7cfb\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e14\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u641c\u7d22\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fb9\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0100\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u7b54\u6848\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "method": "1.

We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression).

Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in generating draft responses for clinicians, yet how physicians refine these drafts remains underexplored. We present a mixed-methods study with nine ophthalmologists answering 144 cataract surgery questions across three conditions: writing from scratch, directly editing LLM drafts, and instruction-based indirect editing. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that while LLM outputs were generally accurate, occasional errors and automation bias revealed the need for human oversight. Contextualization--adapting generic answers to local practices and patient expectations--emerged as a dominant form of editing. Editing workflows revealed trade-offs: indirect editing reduced effort but introduced errors, while direct editing ensured precision but with higher workload.

Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining.

Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent.

Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles. The experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-EDT.

This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments.

Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction.

A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance.

Our approach represents an adder's topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture. The model is first pre-trained on a corpus of randomly synthesized valid prefix adders to learn design rules and then fine-tuned to navigate the design space for optimized design quality. Compared with existing works, PrefixGPT not only finds a new optimal design with a 7.7% improved area-delay product (ADP) but exhibits superior exploration quality, lowering the average ADP by up to 79.1%.

Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\\% accuracy in the top 1\\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\\% asym), and gets 99.8\\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SG-OIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u70b9\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SG-OIF\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673aRichardson\u548c\u9884\u6761\u4ef6Neumann\u7ef4\u62a4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u951a\u70b9IHVPs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u540e\u7aef\u8c03\u8282\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10(20%\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u566a\u58f0)\u4e0a\uff0c\u524d1%\u9884\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91.1%\uff1b\u5728MNIST\u4e0aAUPR\u5f97\u5206\u8fbe99.8%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SG-OIF\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The workshop on Human-Centered Recommender Systems (HCRS) calls for a paradigm shift from optimizing engagement toward designing systems that truly understand, involve, and benefit people. It brings together researchers in recommender systems, human-computer interaction, AI safety, and social computing to explore how human values, e.g., trust, safety, fairness, transparency, and well-being, can be integrated into recommendation processes. Centered around three thematic axes-Human Understanding, Human Involvement, and Human Impact-HCRS features keynotes, panels, and papers covering topics from LLM-based interactive recommenders to societal welfare optimization.

Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pistachio\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b(VAD)\u548c\u7406\u89e3(VAU)\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u5f02\u5e38\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VAD\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u5f02\u5e38\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800cVAU\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u914d\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u8282\u751f\u6210\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u957f\u683c\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa41\u79d2\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "Pistachio\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u591a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "Pistachio\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

MiniCheck-FISCAL outperforms its baseline, surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and other open-source peers of similar size, and approaches the accuracy of much larger systems (20x), such as Mixtral-8x22B and Command R+. On external datasets FinDVer and Fin-Fact, it rivals GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 while outperforming Gemini-1.5 Flash. These results show that domain-specific synthetic data, combined with efficient fine-tuning, enables compact models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and scalability for practical financial AI.

In this work, we propose a whole-body model predictive control (MPC) framework that directly optimizes joint torques through full-order inverse dynamics, enabling unified motion and force planning and execution within a single predictive layer. This approach allows emergent, physically consistent whole-body behaviors that account for the system's dynamics and physical constraints.

However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation. By positioning expert pruning as both a threat vector and a defense target, this work highlights the dual-use nature of MoE modularity and provides the first systematic evaluation framework for secure specialization of MoE-LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86MoE-LLMs\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u4fee\u526a\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "MoE\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u5ec9\u4ef7\u5fae\u8c03\u5269\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8bb8\u53ef\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u635f\u5931-\u6062\u590d\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u4fee\u526a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u5a01\u80c1\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7528\u9014\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aMoE-LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u4f30\u9879\u76ee\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50\u9879\u76ee\u3001\u4ece\u5b8c\u6574\u6807\u51c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u6280\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u6280\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ba1\u67e5\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9879\u76ee\u5e93\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc712,000\u4e2aK-5\u5e74\u7ea7\u7684\u9879\u76ee-\u6280\u80fd\u5bf9\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdLLMs\uff08GPT-3.5 Turbo\u3001GPT-4o-mini\u548cGPT-4o\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50\u9879\u76ee\u3001\u4ece\u5b8c\u6574\u6807\u51c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u6280\u80fd\u5217\u8868\u3002", "result": "GPT-4o-mini\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u523083-94%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u9605\u8bfb\u9886\u57df\u56e0\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u6280\u80fd\u540e\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u6280\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u524d\u4e94\u5efa\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u5019\u9009\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u9879\u76ee\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\\%, 9.6\\% and 12.1\\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv.

However, the performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval module. If the retrieval results have low relevance to user needs or contain noisy information, it will directly lead to distortion of the generated content. In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a trade- off between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding.

The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems. With hindsight, we are able to show that our DRaM solutions to the exact EnP and OnP problems possess derivations that could have been discovered in the time of Gauss, and in fact generalize to all analogous N-dimensional Euclidean pose estimation problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u503c\u77e9\u9635(DRaM)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b33D-3D(EnP)\u548c3D-2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71(OnP)\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230DRaM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6240\u6709N\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u76843D-3D\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u6709SVD\u548c\u56db\u5143\u6570\u7279\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f463D-2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71(OnP)\u95ee\u9898\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u503c\u77e9\u9635(DRaM)\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u65e0\u8bef\u5deeEnP\u548cOnP\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c06QR\u5206\u89e3\u548cMoore-Penrose\u4f2a\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230DRaM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EnP\u548cOnP\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684DRaM\u5bb6\u65cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "DRaM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a3D\u548c2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6240\u6709N\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This stems primarily from their prominent capability in distilling, modeling, and generating comprehensive user preferences. However, previous work fails to examine DMs in recommendation tasks through a rigorous lens. In this paper, we first experimentally investigate the completeness of recommender models from a thermodynamic view. We reveal that existing DM-based recommender models operate by maximizing the energy, while classic recommender models operate by reducing the entropy. Based on this finding, we propose a minimalistic diffusion framework that incorporates both factors via the maximization of Helmholtz free energy. Meanwhile, to foster the optimization, our reverse process is armed with a well-designed denoiser to maintain the inherent anisotropy, which measures the user-item cross-correlation in the context of bipartite graphs. Finally, we adopt an Acceptance-Rejection Gumbel Sampling Process (AR-GSP) to prioritize the far-outnumbered unobserved interactions for model robustness. AR-GSP integrates an acceptance-rejection sampling to ensure high-quality hard negative samples for general recommendation tasks, and a timestep-dependent Gumbel Softmax to handle an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models. Theoretical analyses and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework has distinct superiority over baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u91cf\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u548c\u63a5\u53d7-\u62d2\u7eddGumbel\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u71b5\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u91cf\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u63a5\u53d7-\u62d2\u7eddGumbel\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VISTA-Gym\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u7684VISTA-R1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVISTA-Gym\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7edf\u4e0013\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76847\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3VISTA-R1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVISTA-R1-8B\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u540c\u7c7b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53479.51%-18.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "VISTA-Gym\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u9501\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

Project Page: https://indego-dataset.github.io/", "summary": "We introduce IndEgo, a multimodal egocentric and exocentric dataset addressing common industrial tasks, including assembly/disassembly, logistics and organisation, inspection and repair, woodworking, and others. The dataset contains 3,460 egocentric recordings (approximately 197 hours), along with 1,092 exocentric recordings (approximately 97 hours). A key focus of the dataset is collaborative work, where two workers jointly perform cognitively and physically intensive tasks. The egocentric recordings include rich multimodal data and added context via eye gaze, narration, sound, motion, and others.

However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets.

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets.

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86KOM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5904\u65b9\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6539\u5584\u62a4\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u74036\u4ebf\u591a\u4eba\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1KOM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KOA\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5904\u65b9\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u7981\u5fcc\u75c7\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aKOM\u5728\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5904\u65b9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4e09\u81c2\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5408\u4f5c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bca\u65ad\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f438.5%\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "KOM\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KOA\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u62a4\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5176\u4ed6\u6162\u6027\u75c5AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages. Empirical analysis validates our framework, demonstrating improved estimation and inference performance compared to using either fine-tuning or rectification alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u914d\u6709\u9650\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u793e\u79d1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This limitation leads to incomplete retrieval and compromises the generator's ability to produce accurate and comprehensive answers. To bridge this gap, we propose HKRAG, a new holistic RAG framework designed to explicitly capture and integrate both knowledge types. Our framework features two key components: (1) a Hybrid Masking-based Holistic Retriever that employs explicit masking strategies to separately model salient and fine-print knowledge, ensuring a query-relevant holistic information retrieval; and (2) an Uncertainty-guided Agentic Generator that dynamically assesses the uncertainty of initial answers and actively decides how to integrate the two distinct knowledge streams for optimal response generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain visual question answering benchmarks show that HKRAG consistently outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings, demonstrating the critical importance of holistic knowledge retrieval for VRD understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "HKRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u6863\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u663e\u8457\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u504f\u5411\u68c0\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u77e5\u8bc6\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u8282\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "1. \u6df7\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2. \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHKRAG\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cHKRAG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments.

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u53cd\u9988\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b33D\u88c5\u7bb1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8635%\u7684\u88c5\u7bb1\u574d\u584c\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u88c5\u7bb1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u9759\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6d89\u53ca\u8fde\u7eed\u91cd\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7b80\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u88c5\u7bb1\uff09\u3002\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u529b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff0c\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u5404\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u574d\u584c\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u574d\u584c\u7387\u3002\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u88c5\u7bb1\u574d\u584c\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8635%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u88c5\u7bb1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, the utility of the RF proximities depends upon the success of the RF model, which itself is not the ideal model in all contexts. RF proximities have recently been extended to time series by means of the distance-based Proximity Forest (PF) model, among others, affording time series analysis with the benefits of RF proximities. In this work, we introduce the generalized PF model, thereby extending RF proximities to all contexts in which supervised distance-based machine learning can occur. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the PF model for regression tasks. We also introduce the notion of using the generalized PF model as a meta-learning framework, extending supervised imputation capability to any pre-trained classifier.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u9ed1\u76d2\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u9762\u5411\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6267\u884c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8ba9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u4e00\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u91cd\u5199\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5f3a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u57288\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.\n  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.

Six- axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShapeForce\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u624b\u8155\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5916\u529b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f62\u53d8\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u529b\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u516d\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "motivation": "\u516d\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u788e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002ShapeForce\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u53cd\u9988\u6e90\u3002", "method": "ShapeForce\u5c06\u5916\u529b\u548c\u626d\u77e9\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5176\u67d4\u6027\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f62\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u529b\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6821\u51c6\u6216\u4e13\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cShapeForce\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u516d\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapeForce\u4e3a\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u529b\u503c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5173\u6ce8\u529b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u652f\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528VR\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7c7b\u4eba\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VR\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u63a5\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u56db\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u4efb\u52a1\u542f\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4f19\u4f34\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901f\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u673a\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7c7b\u4eba\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5229\u7528\u5176\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9002\u5e94\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faInfoPrune\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u526a\u679d\u548cFFN\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6548\u7387\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u57fa\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u548cKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f0f\u5934\u526a\u679d\u548c\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3FFN\u538b\u7f29\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728VQAv2\u3001TextVQA\u548cGQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b03.2\u500dFLOP\u51cf\u5c11\u548c1.8\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoPrune\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $\u03c9$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $\u03c9$-regular objective while also adhering to $\u03c9$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\u5e8f\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u8868\u8fbe\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u63a9\u76d6\u5b89\u5168-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u79bb\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u9608\u503c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u6ee1\u8db3\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5230\u7ea6\u675f\u6781\u9650\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u9608\u503c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u6781\u9650\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4fdd\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We introduce a hybrid implicit-explicit representation that fuses neural fields with Gaussian primitives to jointly capture global structural priors and locally observed details. Based on this hybrid state, we derive a hierarchical uncertainty volume that quantifies both implicit global structure quality and explicit local surface confidence. To focus optimization on the most informative regions, we propose an uncertainty-driven keyframe selection strategy that anchors high-entropy viewpoints as sparse attention nodes, coupled with a viewpoint-space sliding window for uncertainty-aware local refinement. The planning module formulates next-best-view selection as an Expected Hybrid Information Gain problem and incorporates a risk-sensitive path planner to ensure efficient and safe exploration.

We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. At the same time, synthetic augmentation expands the diversity of training data for drowsiness recognition.

We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $\u0394(u, v) = |W(u) \\cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\\log(|V|/\u03b4))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering. This manuscript presents the axioms, the main reducibility theorem, complete proofs with explicit constants, and a detailed discussion of compositional design, limitations, and future extensions including multi-bit encodings, weighted witnesses, and non-set representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "REWA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c1\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5355\u8c03\u89c1\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u7f29\u51cf\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6392\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u5404\u79cd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u90bb\u57df\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u5bf9\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u89c1\u8bc1\u96c6\u3001\u534a\u968f\u673a\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u91cd\u53e0\u95f4\u9699\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7O(log(|V|/\u03b4))\u6bd4\u7279\u4fdd\u6301top-k\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u89c1\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86Bloom\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u3001minhash\u3001LSH\u4f4d\u56fe\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "REWA\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c1\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u800c\u975e\u54c8\u5e0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks.

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements.

Code available at https://github.com/mihirs-0/synass", "summary": "Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9006\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u4ecd\u7136\u6bd4\u6b63\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u66f4\u96be\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff1a\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u8bed\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u9694\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u8c03\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50K\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6620\u5c04\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u96f6\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5177\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u71b5\u4e0b\u9650\u7684\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83GPT-2\u548cMLP\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0scratch\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u5982K=5\u65f61.16 nats\uff09\uff0c\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8eMLP\uff1b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6539\u53d8\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u672a\u6d88\u9664\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bLoRA\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u9006\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u5bb9\u91cf\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8bcd\u9891\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\u8fd1\u4f3c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u53ef\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u521a\u6027\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u987a\u6027\uff08\u5bb9\u5fcd\u548c\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u662f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5c42\u8fd0\u52a8\u503e\u5411\u8868\u8fbe\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u4e3b\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6216\u53d1\u51fa\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u808c\u8089\u7ea7\u547d\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u53ef\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62e5\u62b1\u800c\u975e\u62b5\u6297\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u8be5\u4ece\u6291\u5236\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u660e\u786e\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u3002"}}

Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training.

While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.\n  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.\n  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching. We also show that providing in-context reasoning examples from simulated scenes improves performance on real-world and expert-curated questions, demonstrating the effectiveness of perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u6765\u652f\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b5802\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c28033\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u6807\u6ce83173\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u768484\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8c61\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u56db\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u9009\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d10-20%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u793a\u4f8b\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u3002\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations.

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption.

We introduce Dynamic-ICP, a Doppler-aware registration framework. The method (i) estimates ego motion from per-point Doppler velocity via robust regression and builds a velocity filter, (ii) clusters dynamic objects and reconstructs object-wise translational velocities from ego-compensated radial measurements, (iii) predicts dynamic points with a constant-velocity model, and (iv) aligns scans using a compact objective that combines point-to-plane geometry residual with a translation-invariant, rotation-only Doppler residual. The approach requires no external sensors or sensor-vehicle calibration and operates directly on FMCW LiDAR range and Doppler velocities. We evaluate Dynamic-ICP on three datasets-HeRCULES, HeLiPR, AevaScenes-focusing on highly dynamic scenes. Dynamic-ICP consistently improves rotational stability and translation accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u5927\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u5e76\u5728VUE-STG\u548cVUE-TR-V2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aGemini 3 Pro\u548cGPT-5\u7b49\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e0a\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u521b\u4f5c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684VUE-STG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "Vidi2\u5728VUE-TR-V2\u548cVUE-STG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u6fc0\u70c8\u3002", "conclusion": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings.

Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems.

To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer.

Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories. We first introduce ArtiBench, a five-level benchmark covering kitchen, storage, office, and tool environments. ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation.

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \\textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Tri}archy \\textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the \"fake\" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts.

Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems. Analyses of collaboration and diffusion highlight the role of legitimacy, larger actors, and major cities in the spread of figurative norms and semiotic cultures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u5236\u56fe\u9057\u4ea7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea38\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u76ee\u5f55\u7684771,561\u6761\u5730\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c99,715\u5f20\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d61492-1948\u5e74\u516d\u4e2a\u4e16\u7eaa\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u5730\u56fe\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5236\u56fe\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5168\u7403\u9057\u4ea7\u673a\u6784\u5df2\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u5f20\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4e5f\u80fd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc6\u522b\u5730\u56fe\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u4e0e\u5236\u56fe\u5386\u53f2\u6216\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u6587\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u5236\u56fe\u9057\u4ea7\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6765\u81ea38\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u76ee\u5f55\u7684771,561\u6761\u5730\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c99,715\u5f20\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u7528\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5236\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5206\u6790236,925\u4f4d\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5236\u56fe\u5730\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6d77\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u3001\u4e09\u89d2\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u6b96\u6c11\u6269\u5f20\uff09\uff1b\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u56fd\u5bb6\u5173\u6ce8\u7126\u70b9\u548c\u519b\u4e8b\u51b2\u7a81\u5bf9\u51fa\u7248\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e8663M\u7b26\u53f7\u548c25M\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5982\u5730\u5f62\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ebf\u53d6\u4ee3\u9634\u5f71\u7ebf\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u662f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f3a\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5236\u56fe\u9057\u4ea7\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u89c4\u5f8b\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u5316\u5236\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task.

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u65e8\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u53cd\u800c\u6bd4\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u6b64\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u2014\u2014\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u65e2\u6ca1\u6709\u524d\u5411\u8d21\u732e\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u53cd\u5411\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6291\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSA\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u9f13\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5176\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "SSA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSSA\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u591atoken\u53c2\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u8f7b\u6c47\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u610f\u5916\u5730\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dSSA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002SSA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification.

However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5(MAWDO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u77ed\u3001\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u56e0\u5176\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u6210\u4e3a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u65e9\u719f\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAWDO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u79cd\u7fa4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\uff0c\u7531\u4e2a\u4f53\u3001\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aMAWDO\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3469.28\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u6bd4MEWDO\u3001AWDO\u548cWDO\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.51%\u300111.63%\u548c14.93%\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u6700\u5c0f(1.01)\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u4e3a0.71\u3002", "conclusion": "MAWDO\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision.

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.\n  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.\n  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "HunyuanOCR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u7ea7\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8eOCR\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728ICDAR 2025 DIMT\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e00\u540d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728OCRBench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfOCR\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u529f\u80fd\u5355\u4e00\u548c\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MLP\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5546\u4e1aAPI\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728ICDAR 2025 DIMT\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e00\u540d\uff0c\u5728OCRBench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "HunyuanOCR\u5728\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Approaches to Grammatical Error Correction in Low-Resource Settings", "comment": "10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables; Accept-demonstration at BHASHA Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025", "summary": "Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC.

We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $\u03bb$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(\u03bb;\\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u8282\u70b9\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u5d4c\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5747\u5300\u6743\u91cd\uff08\u53cc\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\uff09\uff0c\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u03bb\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u52a0\u6743\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u81ea\u4f34\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u635f\u5931\u7684\u671f\u671b\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u662f\u5426\u7d27\u81f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u533a\u522b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u52a0\u6743\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6L\u00b2(\u03bb;\u211d\u1d48)\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Rayleigh\u5546\u548cLoewner\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fdd\u8bc1\u884c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a0\u6743\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\uff0c\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u4f34\u6027\u800c\u53cc\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u5171\u8bc6\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u6162\u6536\u655b\u3002\u6536\u655b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u8c31\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u8fd8\u6765\u81ea\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5373\u4f7f\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u8c31\u95f4\u9699\u4e5f\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST 2025), Strasburg, France", "summary": "Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data.

We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that skill level is evident not only in how a person performs an activity (video), but also in how they direct their attention when doing so (gaze). Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing. Experiments on three datasets spanning cooking, music, and sports establish, for the first time, the valuable role of gaze in skill understanding across diverse real-world settings. Our SkillSight teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance, while our gaze-only student variant maintains high accuracy using 73x less power than competing methods.

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "REFLEX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700465\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREFLEX\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u53d6\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u8026\u771f\u76f8\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5b9e\u8d28\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cREFLEX\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528465\u4e2a\u81ea\u7cbe\u70bc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5e26\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u65e0\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe7.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "REFLEX\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios.

However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation.

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c06\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u548c\u6545\u4e8b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u4fee\u8865\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u5219\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\u6216\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u521d\u6b65\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Employing an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone, it jointly segments four ROIs - masses, calcifications, axillary findings, and breast tissues - with state-of-the-art accuracy and robustly predicts ten structured clinical features: mass morphology, calcification type, ACR breast density, and BI-RADS categories. To fuse imaging and clinical insights, we developed two late-fusion strategies. By utilizing complementary multimodal data, late fusion strategies improve diagnostic precision and reduce inter-observer variability.

However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $\u03c4^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models.

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SES\u3001MPD\u548cANLD\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1)\u4f7f\u7528\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u6570(SES)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7528\uff0c(2)\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u91cf(MPD)\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c(3)\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u5f52\u4e00\u5316Levenshtein\u8ddd\u79bb(ANLD)\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed(BNLTK)\u548c\u82f1\u8bed(Snowball)\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u6700\u9ad8(1.67)\u4f46ANLD\u4e5f\u9ad8(0.26)\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u9002\u4e2d(1.31)\u4e14ANLD\u5b89\u5168(0.14)\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca(\u9ad8SES)\u548c\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559(\u4f4eANLD)\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3002"}}

Our code is available at https://github.com/DhruvaKashyap/modhifi", "summary": "Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity.

However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines.

We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora.

Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions.

Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.\n  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.\n  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization, addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u7b80\u5355\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4f46\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5982\u4f20\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u6162\u4f46\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u641c\u7d22\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u56f0\u96be\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u641c\u7d22\u7b80\u5355\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%).

Existing approaches either rely on limited segmentation training data, which hinders generalization, or apply zero-shot heuristics to vision-language models (e.g CLIP), while the most competitive approaches combine multiple models to improve performance at the cost of high computational and memory demands. In this work, we leverage an overlooked agglomerative vision foundation model, RADIO, to improve zero-shot OVSS along three key axes simultaneously: mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency. We present the first comprehensive study of RADIO for zero-shot OVSS and enhance its performance through self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and computationally efficient mask refinement.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The resulting compressed models achieve inference speedups of up to 37% on mobile CPU platforms.

Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control.

We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path. On NAVSIM, our method matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods, while avoiding reinforcement learning and maintaining real-time inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAP-World\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u52a0\u6743\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u951a\u70b9\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u951a\u70b9\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f73\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u66ff\u4ee3\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u8f66\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a9\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5019\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u51fa\u672a\u6765BEV\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8def\u5f84\u6743\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u5931\u671f\u671b\u3002", "result": "\u5728NAVSIM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAP-World\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5b8c\u6574\u53ef\u4fe1\u672a\u6765\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $\u03a9(\u03ba^{3/2}\u03b5^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $\u03b5$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $\u03a9(\u03ba^{5/2}\u03b5^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings.

The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5207\u7247\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(min-STP)\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfmin-STP\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u5207\u7247\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5207\u7247\u5668\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6f14\u5316\u6216\u91cd\u590dOT\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76min-STP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfmin-STP\u516c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fbmin-STP\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u644a\u9500\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfmin-STP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u6f14\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684OT\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2026 for possible publication", "summary": "3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u6750\u8d28\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLiDAR-\u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73bb\u7483\u7b49\u7279\u6b8a\u6750\u8d28\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u673a\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u6750\u8d28\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5e26\u6750\u8d28\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eLiDAR-\u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4eff\u771f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528LiDAR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u673a\u4e13\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6750\u8d28\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4eff\u771f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts.

Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification.

In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance.

This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM-AL\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c1170%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b21\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51ed\u501f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6(LLM-AL)\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u503c\u8f93\u5165\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6210\u5206\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLLM-AL\u80fd\u5c06\u8fbe\u5230\u9876\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u5019\u9009\u8005\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c1170%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\u3002LLM-AL\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u884c\u95f4\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u7edfML\u65b9\u6cd5\u5178\u578b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM-AL\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u901a\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.\n  We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.\n  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text. With only three seeds, our paired protocol never declares significance in these settings. We argue that such conservative evaluation is a safer default for small gains under tight budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d1-2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u6539\u8fdb\u662f\u5426\u771f\u5b9e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u5e38\u62a5\u544a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d1-2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u6b65\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5b50\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u52a0\u901f(BCa)\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-10N\u548cAG News\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u975e\u914d\u5bf9t\u68c0\u9a8c\u7ecf\u5e38\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5ba3\u79f00.6-2.0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ece\u4e0d\u5ba3\u79f0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5ba3\u79f0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.\n  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly.

For example, OCR errors like misreading \"50 mph\" as \"60 mph\" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\\% over best baselines.

However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

Moreover, we introduce Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE), a camera-conditioned RoPE phase shift that captures and integrates multi-view relationships within and across the input and target videos. By integrating camera conditions into RoPE, our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation.

Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548cMLP\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5185\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548cMLP\u5c42\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5185\u90e8\u53ef\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Transformer\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5355\u4e2a\u5934\u6216MLP\u5185\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728IOI\u3001GP\u548cGT\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u529f\u80fd\u5934\uff08\u5982\u540d\u79f0\u79fb\u52a8\u5668\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5b50\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u66f4\u52a0\u5206\u5e03\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality.

In this work, we study the geometry of hidden representations in LLMs through the lens of \\textit{intrinsic dimension} (ID), focusing specifically on decision-making dynamics in a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) setting. We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations. Together, these results suggest LLMs implicitly learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured, low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing new geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793aLLM\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5bf928\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u5c42\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684ID\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u51fa\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSoft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u66ff\u4ee3\u786c\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8870\u51cf\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982GSPO\u548cGRPO\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u5728Mixture-of-Experts\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "SAPO\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd1\u7b56\u7565\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e8f\u5217\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSAPO\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684Pass@1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728Qwen3-VL\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0cSAPO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SAPO\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks.

While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence to the target accuracy compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HSFL\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SL\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cHSFL\u5141\u8bb8\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u5907\u5728FL\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u5728SL\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5236\u5b9a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u677e\u5f1b\u95ee\u9898\u83b7\u5f97\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u820d\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u6574\u6570\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6536\u655b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901fHSFL\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion.

However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored.

In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a \"warmup-align\" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer.

Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \\textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics.

However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChessMamba\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68cb\u76d8\u4ea4\u9519\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7a7a\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d8\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChessMamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210SpatialMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u6e90\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68cb\u76d8\u4ea4\u9519\u4e0e\u86c7\u5f62\u626b\u63cf\u987a\u5e8f\u5c06\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6269\u5f20\u5377\u79ef\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4e8c\u5143\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cChessMamba\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ChessMamba\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237/\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u8ff0\u5373\u4f7f\u8be2\u95ee\u76f8\u540c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7acb\u5316\u7b49\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237/\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u88ab\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u90fd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1a\u5b50\u7ec4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u7ec4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7acb\u5316\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b50\u7ec4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u7f13\u89e3\u524d\u8de8\u7ec4\u5206\u6b67\u503c\u8fbe\u52300.28\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u57280.14-0.22\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7acb\u5316\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6b67\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u964d\u81f30.22\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u81f30.17\u6216\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u5b50\u7ec4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "ParaBlock\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ebf\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u90a6\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u5757\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faParaBlock\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u7ebf\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5904\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eParaBlock\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u90a6\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cParaBlock\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ParaBlock\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%).

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedEcho\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8fc7\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedEcho\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u6ede\u540e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cFedEcho\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u5f02\u6b65\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedEcho\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u79c1\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects.

Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time.

This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context.

However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling. These findings establish localized TTS as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LoTTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f3a\u9677\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u522b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5df2\u6ee1\u610f\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u7f3a\u9677\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "LoTTS\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ec5\u5bf9\u7f3a\u9677\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728SD2.1\u3001SDXL\u548cFLUX\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLoTTS\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06GPU\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u6bd4Best-of-N\u91c7\u6837\u964d\u4f4e\u4e862-4\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Project page at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/HybriDLA", "summary": "Conventional document layout analysis (DLA) traditionally depends on empirical priors or a fixed set of learnable queries executed in a single forward pass. While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues. This architecture elevates performance to 83.5% mean Average Precision (mAP). Extensive experiments on the DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks demonstrate that HybriDLA sets a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches.

We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning.

However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., \"sun visor lowered\"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., \"driver wearing a mask\") without any task-specific training.

Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.\n  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDual Graph Filtering (DGF)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe(MMAGs)\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u4e09\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7531\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4f4e\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u70c8\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dual Graph Filtering (DGF)\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u4e09\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u90bb\u57df\u548c\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6MMAG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDGF\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DGF\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u6ee4\u6ce2\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens.

Das"], "title": "RED-F: Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Prediction", "comment": "13 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in mul- tivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction- Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting frame- work, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams.

However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks.

While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning.

In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates.

Utilizing a comprehensive set of 69 predictors -- encompassing market, behavioral, and macroeconomic indicators -- we evaluate the performance of LGBM-based models and compare them with both econometric and machine learning baselines. For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization.

However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration.

While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGGT4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398VGGT\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u5b9e\u73b04D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a20\u5bc6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u9700\u8981\u57284D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c3D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bVGGT\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6269\u5c55VGGT\u7528\u4e8e4D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398VGGT\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Gram\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u653e\u5927\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9510\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u63a9\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u5230VGGT\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a20\u5bc6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u8d85\u8fc7500\u5e27\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "VGGT4D\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6269\u5c553D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u50654D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $\u0398\\left(1/t\\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound.

However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content.

Accepted at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art.

In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples.

This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation.

This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \\ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u8003\u9a71\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u7ec6\u5fae\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653e\u5927\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u8003\u9a71\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5fae\u8c03\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8349\u7a3f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u7ec6\u8282\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fee\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002"}}

When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \\emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes,\" geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images.

Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images.

However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.\n  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying \"non-motorized lane\" signs as \"motorized lane\" and \"pedestrian\" as \"plastic bag\".\n  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations.

However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step.

However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity\n  , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anon\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728SGD\u548cAdam\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5982Adam\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5982\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAnon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6bd4AMSGrad\u7684\u786c\u6700\u5927\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5728\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0cAnon\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f25\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention.

Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels.

In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods.

HACBSR comprises two components: (1) a contrastive kernel sampling mechanism with kernel similarity control to mitigate distribution bias from Gaussian sampling, and (2) a history-augmented contrastive learning that uses historical models to generate negative samples to enable less greedy optimization and to induce strong convexity without ground-truth.

While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms.

To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points.

Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods.

In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function.

Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction.

However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \\textit{in vivo} CEST scans.

Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target.

Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCONVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u9ad8\u4eae\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u5230VAD\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6982\u5ff5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbCBM\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u5de5\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "CONVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3aVAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.\n  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eCSI\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eCSI\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5fae\u5999\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u6cdb\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u524d\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7d27\u51d1\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u767d\u76d2\u3001\u9ed1\u76d2/\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6270\u52a8\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u660e\u663e\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4ec5\u9002\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5e72\u51c0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u7740\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u5411\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety.

This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method.

Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively.

As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets. Existing approaches either over-rely on pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability, or analyze the lung in fragments, weakening performance. We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation.

We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation.

Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation.

In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $\u03b2_1, \u03b2_2 \\in [0,1)$.

While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions.

This capability makes it suitable as a generative prior for image restoration tasks. Although current methods leveraging flow models have shown promising results in restoration, some still suffer from long processing times or produce over-smoothed results. To address these challenges, we introduce Restora-Flow, a training-free method that guides flow matching sampling by a degradation mask and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism to enforce consistency with degraded inputs. We evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets across several image restoration tasks involving a mask-based degradation, i.e., inpainting, super-resolution and denoising.

However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86E2E-GRec\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1aGNN\u79bb\u7ebf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u8026\u8303\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u5b50\u56fe\u91c7\u6837\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3\uff09\u4e24\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eGradnorm\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cE2E-GRec\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u957f\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53470.133%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8df3\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u5747\u6570\u51cf\u5c110.3171%\u3002", "conclusion": "E2E-GRec\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7edf\u4e00GNN\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability.

For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f00\u59cb/\u7ed3\u675f\u7684\u65f6\u523b\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u624b\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b2\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528250\u540d\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u6807\u6ce8\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u91ca\u653e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8ba9\u4e24\u4e2aLMM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u547d\u540d\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u6301\u7eed\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f00\u59cb/\u7ed3\u675f\u7684\u5e27\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u523b\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u89e3\u6240\u9700\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry.

This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHarmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u672a\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5f53\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u8c03\u4f18\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHPA\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5212\u5206\u3001\u548c\u8c10\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u6309\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ece\u5e73\u8861\u89d2\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u65bd\u52a0\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHPA\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "HPA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u8c03\u4f18\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniAlpha\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217RGBA\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684MSRoPE-BiL\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cAlphaLayers\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u572821\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3RGBA\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u73b0\u72b6\uff1a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5c40\u9650\u4e8eRGB\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6865\u63a5\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniAlpha\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MSRoPE-BiL\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u5411\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5c42\u8f74\u7684\u65b0\u578bRoPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u7684Diffusion Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e76\u53d1\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51faRGBA\u5c42\u3002\u6784\u5efaAlphaLayers\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u5c42\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u572821\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728AIM-500\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u63a9\u7801\u62a0\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dSAD\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e84.8%\uff0c\u5728\u5c42\u6761\u4ef6\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d62\u5f97\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u4f18\u7684RGBA\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations.

The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization.

Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints.

However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods.

Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training.

This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact.

However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept.

Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness.

These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions.

Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections.

Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively.

However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions.

Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging.

Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space. This interaction enables the system to effectively learn both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data.

The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks.

However, existing specialized PEFT methods often fail when applied to large-scale Earth observation tasks, as they are unable to fully handle the multifaceted and unpredictable domain gaps (\\eg, spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts) inherent in RS data. To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow.

However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "TReFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a6f\u5316\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b65\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528CycleGAN-Turbo\u5230RF\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TReFT\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DiT\u6216UNet\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728SD3.5\u548cFLUX\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RF\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528TReFT\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "TReFT\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RF\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e00\u6b65\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002"}}

While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information.

However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360\u00b0 panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense.

Furthermore, we introduce a cyclic optimization strategy to refine the 3D tampering attribute, enabling more accurate tampering localization.

Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \\emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090.

Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \\times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \\times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "FREE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668(DiTs)\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728ImageNet-512\u00b2\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52302.25\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "DiTs\u867d\u7136\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728DiTs\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790DiTs\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9876\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u3002\u63d0\u51faFREE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8349\u7a3f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53d7\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-512\u00b2\u4e0a\uff0cFREE\u5b9e\u73b01.86\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0cFREE(relax)\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8fbe\u52302.25\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FREE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DiTs\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5MultiID\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ID\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408\u5230\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u5236\u7c98\u8d34\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355ID\u5b9a\u5236\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u88c1\u526a\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u533a\u57df\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u590d\u5236\u7c98\u8d34\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u53ea\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiID\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ID\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u4e0d\u540cID\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u6027\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u6784\u5efaIDBench\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eMultiID\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiID\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

Our method fuses segmented RGB images and LiDAR point clouds using Gaussian Splatting to construct a traversability-aware Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) that jointly encodes geometry and semantics. Updated online, this field enables semantic reasoning to distinguish traversable vegetation (e.g., tall grass) from rigid obstacles (e.g., trees), while LiDAR ensures 360-degree geometric coverage for extended planning horizons. We validate Splatblox on a quadruped robot and demonstrate transfer to a wheeled platform. In field trials across vegetation-rich scenarios, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods with over 50% higher success rate, 40% fewer freezing incidents, 5% shorter paths, and up to 13% faster time to goal, while supporting long-range missions up to 100 meters.
